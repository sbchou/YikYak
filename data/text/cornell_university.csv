@ParisBurned jockstraps are another example of black "queer" assimilation. Thank Pleasure Island and the lack of BLk identity@ParisBurned In my humble opinion. Blk gay men, in this era, are looking to white gay culture to define their own.
@ParisBurned I don't remember back in my early gay years when black men were interested in jockstraps and they like.
@ParisBurned how can one  seek visibility when your self identity is invisible
@C_Conover If the bar was in February,  when will u know if you passed?
@ParisBurned and where do you think they got that ideology from? But maybe those scenes subcultures existed all along unbeknownst to me
@ParisBurned it's just disturbing to me that you see now more often than not "race unimportant" or "open to all races"
@ParisBurned but when I quote Marlon Riggs, Blk men loving Blk men is a revolutionary act " folk seem bothered
@ParisBurned or even in mere conversation in gay spaces
@ParisBurned grindr, jack'd, Adam, scruff.. Take your pick
"@ParisBurned: *visits MyVidster*" Chile! Lol"@ParisBurned: @Theartistjmike they won't be able to handle all this pro-blackness/pro-black gayness." Agreed!!!
@ParisBurned that code is definitely applicable to most other cultures
@ParisBurned people are entitled to date whomever they please ... But why is it that I'm questioned when I find empowerment in black love
I can totally do a @ClementsLandon impression!! #SouthernCharm
I need to get it together
@ParisBurned and you just defined lack if identity... Why are folk engaging this pressure?
@ParisBurned I do agree with you that the pressure to date is real and at the same time often devastating
@ParisBurned mind you this often times comes from other black men.. It was all rhetorical... I know you get it@ParisBurned blackness has always been varied... When one specifically dates out their race self hate then needs to be negotiated!
@ParisBurned  I'm not at all saying deny yourself love

You can't truly fight on behalf of an outgroup. And you cannot truly enter into an outgroup without sacrificing another in group.
#Ithaca pitstop. @maxowen09 is on the right. 👍🍻 @ Ithaca Beer Co. https://t.co/tcYkdrxtggEvery white SJW speaking on behalf of POC betrays his own cause through imposing white projection of black interests into the discourse.
telling whites people to shut up and listen poisons the well
I'm not really in to movements that necessitate being a huge asshole to people.
Similarly, I am not in to people being such huge assholes to begin with that said movements feel the need to act the way they do

@kim_crawley @FunkyreFresh ...states were unfit for statehood and could not assure their own security. So they got colonized. It helped.
@kim_crawley @FunkyreFresh yeah, Australian aborigines were accomplishing so much before Brits. Only reason colonialism happened is those...
Never getting to see my boyfriend is just fucking great. So fun. 👌😒
Lmfao it's ahistorical to suggest colonized states couldn't assure their own security. Yeah no, pretty much a fact.
Yeah, Britain took control over 25% of the world, but not because states it colonized couldn't get shit together. Right.

@CapnCassidy I can imagine an unlikely scenario.
@CapnCassidy you asked if Ukraine is inferior. The implication of my answer is "yes." It is inferior in living standards, security, etc.@CapnCassidy Ukraine cannot defend itself effectively and needs protection from larger power. It is also corrupt and cannot run itself.@CapnCassidy that doesn't mean Britain did anything wrong. They couldn't unite and organize a defense, now can't adapt. A lesson.

Don't have a bio in the Execution of Justice playbill because I simply forgot to send it. Classic. #lowpriority #stugglingthismonthMiley through 3 IP: No hits, no walks, four ground outs, five strikeouts. Impressive pitch mix with a plus change up, slider.
Last year, Miley started using his slider a lot more, which is the pitch he has the highest whiff percentage on. Strikeout rate went up.
"Jukia" was written on my coffee. Not even close.Sandy Leon stole that third strike against A-Rod. Looks to be an incredibly adept pitch framer. #RedSoxWade Miley is running through the #Yankees, dare I say, 🎶LIKE A WRECKING BALL🎶 http://t.co/c0TtFqGdG8

#EveryoneSlapTheTits
Don’t understand how Farrell can keep Allen Craig, who hits .348/.414/.554 with RISP, on the bench in that situation. #RedSox
Cornell was beautiful❤️ http://t.co/yY1IMx6VWNCraig in his career has hit .298/.375/.579 with two outs and runners on first and second in his career (64 PA). I don’t get it. #RedSox
Mookie Betts does not look like a guy who became a full-time outfielder less than a year ago. Has command of OF, gets good jumps generally.
Make sense of everything
Every A- I got I had to work my ass off.
B+ is just like
Half an hour a day. Max.
B+ is the perfect grade.
Anything above that is diminishing returns.
@skmsw then when are stats predictive? He has 500+ PA with RISP.
WE HAVE MORE MICROBREWS THAN MINNEAPOLIS. SWPL CAPITOL.@skmsw When there is a big sample size, 500 PA, a 60 pt difference from career avg to a situation would make you the luckiest guy ever.
@skmsw No, I get where you’re coming from. But I can’t imagine Craig has been SO lucky to the point that he hits 60 pts better with RISP
@leannrimes @sweetnsaucyshop THAT is an awesome cake!!!Gollum is a dickhead

guys remember when the lights went out and they had to stop playing baseball for like 20 minutes
guys, remember when we were all excited that wade miley was only taking 10 seconds between pitches so the game would end quickly

Damn. BU after this one, hits me right in the feels. Hell of a season. Congrats to Providence. #StillProudToBU
This might be one of the biggest chokes I’ve ever seen in a sporting event. In the national championship game. https://t.co/cTJIn34qXK
I’ve never been a fan of Matt O’Connor, but man, I feel bad for him right now. Brutal way to lose a championship.I don’t think I’ve ever seen a game where the blame on a championship can so clearly fall on one person’s shoulders.
@sox_fan9 he was statistically among the best in the country this year. If that’s not a choke, what is?
Providence played great in the 3rd period, but nobody will ever remember that. You can’t even do what O’Connor did in video games.stress zits are really fun and attractive because who doesn't enjoy growing another head out of their face #ihateeveryone@sox_fan9 do you think Grady Little choked?
@apv_insd this is worse.
*posts video link to Pink Floyd album on YouTube*
@apv_insd no I feel so bad for him. But this goal will forever be replayed over and over. It’s just a reality of an error of that magnitude.

@Wyldawen @380kmh I'm Mickey Mouse shit dumb cannon fodder for everyone. You just don't like the side I'm cannon fodder for.@Wyldawen @380kmh I'd love a Happening. It's long overdue. Blow everything up let the next generation start in ruins and build it better.
@Wyldawen @380kmh Effectively the exact same thing.
If privilege is the problem let's actually destroy everything so privilege is a privilege again and not a problem.
@Wyldawen @380kmh I lack nuance? I'm LARPing an orc for a reason. You're too much of an idealist to have practical solutions.
@BryFone i think we have the same routine rn
@BryFone i fucking knew it too
if you ban white people from an anti-racism event are you effectively admitting that racism isn't really a problem for white people?
this is perfect i love how britain is just organically orwellian http://t.co/ZAZKsOfZWN

@Wyldawen @380kmh your threat/presidential candidate has to be actionable before it becomes scary though lol lmao roosh didn't kill anyone
Can my excuse for not practicing piano for tomorrow be because it's earth day....? 🌍🌎🌏🎹
@Wyldawen @380kmh I'd support this if it was actually possible tho http://t.co/6sWryKQ4VA
@Wyldawen @380kmh roosh is such a triviality but nice to see where you stand in terms of rape-fetishism (ie. thought crime) vs. cop killing
the shit monica sends to the group message http://t.co/hqaIiqHuZi
@Wyldawen @380kmh I didn't realize calling someone a "triviality" was "hugging" them. look at the stats of who commits rapes btw silly woman@Wyldawen @380kmh lmao ethnic cleansing support from the left; you've been reading too many reactionaries -- this isn't progressive at all
@Wyldawen @380kmh Are Taliban ideas of women that "they are disproportionately more likely to be raped by black men than white rightists?"
kmeskill @brandon_mander working hard today @ Valor Strength &amp; Conditioning https://t.co/NmHNYNqQQA
@Wyldawen @380kmh ving consensual sex with foreign women. Right.
@Wyldawen @380kmh "Vankatesh" isn't a white surname. Roosh is such an underhanded rapist of those close to him that's why he writes about ha
@Wyldawen @380kmh Dude's clearly Indian. Last I checked in the PC cosmology Indians are "brown people" reactionaries supposed to hate.
what is roosh some fucking boogey man he's literally a rando who writes books about how he gets laid why is he under discussion who cares@Wyldawen @380kmh bahahaha, how little you know me indeed.
@Wyldawen @380kmh you missed all that drama where everyone on the right accused roosh of being an sjw for deleting racist topics didn't you
Oh no - what a tragedy.  http://t.co/JtocI1rmzS
@Wyldawen @380kmh idgaf. the poster is insulting, but it's still just bullshit words on paper. you were just defending cop killing.
@Wyldawen @380kmh okay, so it's okay to kill murderous gangs? vigilantism isn't wrong? if i kill bloods, it's okay?@Wyldawen @380kmh lmfao
killing actual gangs of criminals = wrong
killing legitimate law enforcement personnel = fine and dandy
ok
@Wyldawen @380kmh i know quite a few blacks who strongly disagree with this sentiment
@380kmh  lmao kantbot asked me for help against old @Wyldawen during their first encounter
@offs12 ongoing twitter argument
@Wyldawen @380kmh Law enforcement personnel are victimized by bad state policies as much as anyone else.

&gt; paints a profession with a broad brush
@Wyldawen @380kmh yeah do you want me to tell you how blacks are lawless rapist savages based on articles i read on the news too?
@Wyldawen @380kmh like you're mad at him for not holding roosh in high regard rn
@Wyldawen @380kmh you know when he was talking about both of those things, he was siding with you against roosh, right?

If a man attempts to socially isolate his woman, that's abusive controlling behavior. Agreed. But i see girls pull this consistently.
Women are always accusing men of the same shit that they do all the time. "gas lighting," manipulation, etc. men don't do need to do this.

my mom told me she didn't wanna watch breaking bad because she didn't wanna cheer for a drug dealer but she watched weeds with me so idk
@Urban_IX idk I didn't watch past season 5 or 6
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington Adderall definitely increases INT and WIS in terms of analytic reasoning and perception. More talkative is CHA.
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington WIS is the determinant for sensory perception scores, ie. Perception (Spot, Hear checks); Adderall aids that.

@Urban_IX @PolarWashington Yeah, concerta, focalin, ritalin are all methylphenidates. Amphetamines are adderall, vyvanse.if you ever sell vyvanse to kids make sure to tell them snorting it doesn't work
@PolarWashington @Urban_IX I'm not on any, I've never had any of the above prescribed, I'd just bought them all from kids at some point.

@Tipsycaek but if I smoke right before bed, I don't remember anything at all.
@Tipsycaek I tend to have good dream recall if I go to bed on nothing. Melatonin or high dose of protein and I'll have serious vivid dreams.
@Urban_IX @PorphyConob @PolarWashington no, but i share my apt with someone with an adderall prescription who's failed to refill it.
@ASAPINEY i mean my experience are facts 
(to me)
@Tipsycaek I love dreaming.

For me, it isn’t just pace of play for MLB that’s pushing away young fans. It’s the culture of gentrification discouraging individuality.
I’m way more drawn to Yasiel Puig than Mike Trout because of the chance to see something different. Trout’s consistency can be boring.
hey if ur cute plz post pics thx#tbt Celebrating a clean sweep racing weekend in the Feitner 🚣⚡️🚣⚡Let's do it again! #iccrew… https://t.co/fLnGHu9HoM
Puig is different, a must watch every night because you never know what you’re going to get. He’s “Vine-able.” That’s what gets eyes now.
The America Dream (as a first-generation American) encourages individuality. People celebrate that and baseball’s culture hampers that.
I LIKE HOW I'M IN CHARGE OF THE DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS OF NRX AND MPC I DON'T EVEN VISIT MPC
There’s something to be said that Puig feels pressure to get rid of bat flips to fit into baseball culture and be different.

Let's empower women by telling them men are oppressing them.

Sometimes the mind will oppress itself.

Do not be alarmed.

That is patriarchy.

I support the notion of having everyone take the sociopath test. I bet $100 less than 10% on the alt-right would score high on it.
To expand it is to reduce its quality and worth.
The empathy being packaged and sold is a cheap mass produced sort of empathy. Truly, empathy is a limited resource.
Save your love for people who love you. Don't pretend to love the whole world. The whole world doesn't love you back.
Empathy is most felt toward people we are close to. It is foolish to be empathetic to strangers and loose connections constantly.
I'm far more suspicious of the people who feel the need to go out of their way to signal universal kindness. They're hiding something.
I don't need to prove I'm not a sociopath. Being accused of sociopathy on the internet is a good thing. Means ego security is strong.
