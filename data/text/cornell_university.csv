@ParisBurned jockstraps are another example of black "queer" assimilation. Thank Pleasure Island and the lack of BLk identity@ParisBurned In my humble opinion. Blk gay men, in this era, are looking to white gay culture to define their own.
@ParisBurned I don't remember back in my early gay years when black men were interested in jockstraps and they like.
@ParisBurned how can one  seek visibility when your self identity is invisible
@C_Conover If the bar was in February,  when will u know if you passed?
@ParisBurned and where do you think they got that ideology from? But maybe those scenes subcultures existed all along unbeknownst to me
@ParisBurned it's just disturbing to me that you see now more often than not "race unimportant" or "open to all races"

@ParisBurned that code is definitely applicable to most other cultures
@ParisBurned people are entitled to date whomever they please ... But why is it that I'm questioned when I find empowerment in black love
I can totally do a @ClementsLandon impression!! #SouthernCharm
I need to get it together
@ParisBurned and you just defined lack if identity... Why are folk engaging this pressure?
@ParisBurned I do agree with you that the pressure to date is real and at the same time often devastating
@ParisBurned mind you this often times comes from other black men.. It was all rhetorical... I know you get it@ParisBurned blackness has always been varied... When one specifically dates out their race self hate then needs to be negotiated!
@ParisBurned  I'm not at all saying deny yourself love

Tank for Carter Clarke Burton next year right?I was just told a joke I wrote on Facebook back to me and it was even funnier.
#EveryoneSlapTheTits
Don‚Äôt understand how Farrell can keep Allen Craig, who hits .348/.414/.554 with RISP, on the bench in that situation. #RedSox
Cornell was beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è http://t.co/yY1IMx6VWNCraig in his career has hit .298/.375/.579 with two outs and runners on first and second in his career (64 PA). I don‚Äôt get it. #RedSox
Mookie Betts does not look like a guy who became a full-time outfielder less than a year ago. Has command of OF, gets good jumps generally.
Make sense of everything
Every A- I got I had to work my ass off.
B+ is just like
Half an hour a day. Max.
B+ is the perfect grade.
Anything above that is diminishing returns.
@skmsw then when are stats predictive? He has 500+ PA with RISP.
WE HAVE MORE MICROBREWS THAN MINNEAPOLIS. SWPL CAPITOL.@skmsw When there is a big sample size, 500 PA, a 60 pt difference from career avg to a situation would make you the luckiest guy ever.
@skmsw No, I get where you‚Äôre coming from. But I can‚Äôt imagine Craig has been SO lucky to the point that he hits 60 pts better with RISP
@leannrimes @sweetnsaucyshop THAT is an awesome cake!!!Gollum is a dickhead
Xander Bogaerts with an outstanding play at short to end the inning, and we head to the 12th in the Bronx #RedSox
My friend is bringing nutella to the bar LMAO
@skmsw Anyways, enjoyed this discussion! Thanks for following along.
Miley tried to pitch quick enough so this game could get in under 3 hours. The baseball gods were like NAH and now it‚Äôs gonna end in 17.When your dad drunk texts you while you are also drunk
THE BASEBALL GODS HATE THE RED SOX AND YANKEES SO THIS GAME WILL NEVER END.

This would be the lighting company kindly asking to finish this one up
how funny would it be if this game got suspended in 2015 because of darkness
A couple of guys turned on the flashlights of their phones to help out... Clever
the year is 2015. we have computers in our pockets. and a game might get suspended because of darkness. #paceofplayI should hit up Cornell bars more the girls here are cute as hell and acting way less degenerate.

Is Beyonc√© at the game or something? She did knock out the lights at the Super Bowl that one year.
So we're looking at 15 more minutes of delays... Anybody have any queens? #GoFish
It cost 1.5 billion dollars to build Yankee Stadium and we can‚Äôt even keep the lights on.

This might be one of the biggest chokes I‚Äôve ever seen in a sporting event. In the national championship game. https://t.co/cTJIn34qXK
I‚Äôve never been a fan of Matt O‚ÄôConnor, but man, I feel bad for him right now. Brutal way to lose a championship.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a game where the blame on a championship can so clearly fall on one person‚Äôs shoulders.
@sox_fan9 he was statistically among the best in the country this year. If that‚Äôs not a choke, what is?
Providence played great in the 3rd period, but nobody will ever remember that. You can‚Äôt even do what O‚ÄôConnor did in video games.stress zits are really fun and attractive because who doesn't enjoy growing another head out of their face #ihateeveryone@sox_fan9 do you think Grady Little choked?
@apv_insd this is worse.
*posts video link to Pink Floyd album on YouTube*
@apv_insd no I feel so bad for him. But this goal will forever be replayed over and over. It‚Äôs just a reality of an error of that magnitude.

@thtawkwrdmment Personally I take it as an affront if I can't get someone to spray their beverage of choice across a room. Good show!That's generally what is happening when a man is "whipped."

Women are always accusing men of the same shit that they do all the time. "gas lighting," manipulation, etc. men don't do need to do this.

@PolarWashington @Urban_IX meth, adderall, no these are all good things for orcs. Compensates for the INT, WIS, CHA penalties.
It's April 23; why is it still snowing??
my mom told me she didn't wanna watch breaking bad because she didn't wanna cheer for a drug dealer but she watched weeds with me so idk
@Urban_IX idk I didn't watch past season 5 or 6
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington Adderall definitely increases INT and WIS in terms of analytic reasoning and perception. More talkative is CHA.
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington WIS is the determinant for sensory perception scores, ie. Perception (Spot, Hear checks); Adderall aids that.

@Urban_IX @PolarWashington huh; concerta is methylphenidate though, did you get similar results from amphetamines?
Wrong hole #ManlyHandsoapScents
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington Methylphenidates I think tend to have shorter length of effects for me. Concerta is my least favorite of them all
@Urban_IX @PolarWashington Yeah, concerta, focalin, ritalin are all methylphenidates. Amphetamines are adderall, vyvanse.if you ever sell vyvanse to kids make sure to tell them snorting it doesn't work
@PolarWashington @Urban_IX I'm not on any, I've never had any of the above prescribed, I'd just bought them all from kids at some point.

@Urban_IX @PolarWashington oh I mean if alcohol counts I should mention I smoke pot -- been messing with my sleep cycle recently though.
Marijuana also reduces dream recall significantly.
Something to be said of marijuana's effects on your sleep cycle.
That is to say, you'd think it'd make it easier to sleep, but it does not.
@Tipsycaek well yeah, alcohol messes with memory far more than weed does; though idk i usually wake up from vivid dreams in hangovers.
@PorphyConob @Urban_IX @PolarWashington I'VE BEEN DENIED MY ADDERALL TAX THAT WAS CONDITION FOR THE SIGNING OF MY LEASE FOR TWO MONTHS NOW@ASAPINEY Should I attach "IMO/IME" to every tweet and waste the characters or can that be reasonably intuited from the fact that I say it?
@Tipsycaek but if I smoke right before bed, I don't remember anything at all.
@Tipsycaek I tend to have good dream recall if I go to bed on nothing. Melatonin or high dose of protein and I'll have serious vivid dreams.
@Urban_IX @PorphyConob @PolarWashington no, but i share my apt with someone with an adderall prescription who's failed to refill it.
@ASAPINEY i mean my experience are facts

For me, it isn‚Äôt just pace of play for MLB that‚Äôs pushing away young fans. It‚Äôs the culture of gentrification discouraging individuality.

Puig is different, a must watch every night because you never know what you‚Äôre going to get. He‚Äôs ‚ÄúVine-able.‚Äù That‚Äôs what gets eyes now.
The America Dream (as a first-generation American) encourages individuality. People celebrate that and baseball‚Äôs culture hampers that.
I LIKE HOW I'M IN CHARGE OF THE DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS OF NRX AND MPC I DON'T EVEN VISIT MPC
There‚Äôs something to be said that Puig feels pressure to get rid of bat flips to fit into baseball culture and be different.

I support the notion of having everyone take the sociopath test. I bet $100 less than 10% on the alt-right would score high on it.
To expand it is to reduce its quality and worth.
The empathy being packaged and sold is a cheap mass produced sort of empathy. Truly, empathy is a limited resource.
Save your love for people who love you. Don't pretend to love the whole world. The whole world doesn't love you back.
Empathy is most felt toward people we are close to. It is foolish to be empathetic to strangers and loose connections constantly.
I'm far more suspicious of the people who feel the need to go out of their way to signal universal kindness. They're hiding something.
