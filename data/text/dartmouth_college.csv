@PhilipJTaylor1 @LabourEoin we have had imptnt helpers such as @sjwrenlewis @PaulKrugmanBlog
@asentance @britishchambers i guess you didnt spot everything was slowing as the strong exchange rate killed exports - every index was down?
@asentance arent weak trade figures weak as is the fall in profitability?
The northeast has too much chill
@aozora_aonami @LabourEoin we should thank them for making clear to British voter how thoroughly despicable the nasty party's campaign is@patmcburt Fallon always was a mouth waiting to happen
@Holbornlolz this ? Latest YouGov / The Sun results 8th April - Con 34%, Lab 35%, LD 8%, UKIP 13%, GRN 5%@Holbornlolz wow what a huge swing so if that goes thru labour SNP next govt right?
@jlatty @Holbornlolz but @LordAshcroft polls in marginals suggest swing bigger there - nasty Ozzie campaign seems to be turning Brits  off
$534,735,000.00
@Holbornlolz so average of last 6 polls has labour 2pts ahead right?  your boys are in deep trouble - time to stab themselves in the back?
@Holbornlolz @jlatty @LordAshcroft of course seems like it is a tie so far but no sign of any crossing
@Holbornlolz @jlatty @LordAshcroft dont bet
@Holbornlolz haha
Much enjoyed teaching my @dartmouth econ class today who sat &amp; listened in the next room to me talking fed to @Kathleen_Hays &amp; @VonnieQuinn@bournemouthian so tories clutching at their ankles when they saw the 6pt lead for labour right? lolxMani, pedi time💅🏼
@BarbaraMercer76 @LabourEoin :)
@Colin00007 UKIP will be a les than powerful force in the UK with 1 seat i suspect
problem with getting Fallon to be a rottweiler is that he one and it is hard to find anyone who likes him enough to take him seriously

@TimNekritz I know. It's my last hope.A1 Secure all usernames, everywhere! Such a lame answer but currently dealing w/ someone having a username we need #frustrating #strategycar
@TimNekritz I *try* to make this regular practice. So important to stay in touch. Plus makes my audits of the social ecosystem easier!I think it completely depends on your brand + audience + "social ecosystem." I think you should have access to FB + Twitter. #strategycarJust heard an awesome talk from @LeymahRGbowee (future @dartmouth mom)  on how women can end wars by speaking up. http://t.co/sLatX5YP0cA4: Asking them what are the most common questions/comments they get + how do they answer them. Shows how easy content can be. #strategycar
A4: The word content can sound scary. Need to show them how to look at their everyday + see the content right in front of them #strategycar@TimNekritz Everyone can get behind telling a story! "Creating content?" Not so much! #strategycarFirst shift at the library. Made up my fave shelf already with @FaithErinHicks Superhero girl, @Julia_Wertz Infinite Wait, and Blacksad.
