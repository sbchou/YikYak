This game is being called so softly. Let em play dammit
Really hoping it miraculously snows like 10 inches tonight so we don't have to go back to school tomorrow.

These refs are blowing the game for Duke.

Refs hesitating... Cause they wanna call everything Wiscons... Aahhh nevermind. That wasn't too obvious.
@Irep_MAHSELF .
More power to those people.
@emmmma21 i kinda like it haha
People who mock others who make min wage are ignorant. Every one has a story. Sometimes its they're fault or life isnt easy. Theyre trying.
@emmmma21 well duh. I think it means we've snapchatted at least once for the past 13 days, too.

My residents are going to hate me next year for blasting Indian music 24/7
ALLEN IS BALLING!
Why anyone would want Duke to win this game is beyond me... It's all about Wisconsin this year
Bronson Koenig &amp; Grayson Allen are the biggest performers in this game. Just like you and your stupid friends predicted
@zherzberg3 not as much as I hate frank kaminsky
Will admit, number 3 on dukes side is pretty hot 😍🔥🏀
I swear I can't with these bitches 😂
Grayson Allen is the only reason why Duke is still in this game
honestly I don't need this shit anymore, goodbye "memories" fuck you☺️ the future looks bright as hell and I'm not stressing one bit aboutu😘
@Nursenance9 @salmondine @JChurchRadio @GCRNFade2Black  I just tuned in Nancy and I'm afraid to ask what u guys are tweeting about!

@zherzberg3 Kaminsky is way too over rated now after this tournament , Allen's a star off the bench
Armenian girls are extremely beautiful 😍
I feel so good rn
Forget Kaminsky what about Grayson Allen?😳
everyone yells at me because I let people take advantage of me but when I stand up for myself and say no I turn into the bad guyWisconsin needs to pick it up CMON

"I was drunk so of course I was sending him nudey snapchats."
That would have been a nice take if Tyus Jones wasn't so ugly

This research paper is the dumbest thing I've ever had to do in my life. Why stress us out and create more work for us to do?!
The refs clearly took Okafor and Winslow out of the game and Kaminsky had 1 foul. But Duke gets all the calls.... Am I missing something?

For instance people can make the defense against same sex marriage as an infringment against their freedom of religion.

This kid at the park said, "I'm off now, I'm mad tired I was at church." He acts like you have to do a physical fitness test at church.😂😂
@stevehendley that's assuming he's guilty, obviously. But given that he turned himself in, I have to think he is
#bucciovertimechallenge Backstrom / okposo
@CAeveryday a valid point (#DBU and such) but is that what should determine whether or not he gets kicked off as opposed to what he did?

It's fascinating watching vids of @Cristiano during his earlier days at Manchester United. He is a different player now, but still brilliant
Tim Tebow and his choir boy act are annoying.
Mid to late 2000's he was a rampaging athlete that never stopped running at defenders w/ the ball. Now he's transformed into a goal machine

@JoeyMaamari thanks bro😄
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different.Don't do drugs, just take someHappy 420!!! DEALS ALL DAY HMU
Sixers have options. My fav would be signing Butler to a max deal, but another, more unlikely deal would be signing Aldridge &amp; trading Noel
Draft DeAngelo Russell, keep Embiid, sign Aldridge, trade Noel &amp; picks for a star. That team would be instant contenders.Shit I left my softball bag outside :)
Sixers 2015 15man roster prediction: Joel, Noel, DRuss, Wroten, T-Rob, Jakarr, LRMAM, Canaan, GR3, RC3, JRich, Grant, McRae, FA, 2nd rd pick
Other guys that may crack Sixers roster: Pierre Jackson, Dario Saric, another FA or 2nd rd pick, Vasilije Micic, Ish Smith, Aldemir, Hollis
rain on Mondays should be illegal
I don't think Sims will be back. I think he's a decent player but they have 4 guys they value higher in Joel, Noel, Furkan &amp; T-Rob.So many Philly sports moments I can't wait for...NFL draft, NBA lottery, NBA draft, Murray's 1st carry, Nola's 1st start, Embiid's 1st game
@washdental my son is off to PITT if fall.  He'll be on dental track. Wants to be an orthodontist.

happy birthday @JasmineClark09 😇🎉💐
Eagles were trying to trade Barkley before signing Tebow so they obv favor Tebow over him, leading me to believe Tebow will be 3rd string QB
Happy 4-20
Barkley being written off is unfair IMO. I cannot count a guy out who was drafted but never got a chance to prove himself. Maybe Im too fair
You know what day it is 4/20 boytta start this shit rightHappy 4/20 everyone!! ❤️💚💛
So today's the Boston Marathon. Be careful and vigilant if you will be there. Report ANYTHING suspicious to authorities.
I think I hate Chip as a GM so much bc of his lack of urgency in bringing back members of the 2012 draft

For for this reason, I have already seen the Full House spin off, and so has everyone. Carry on.
I have literally never heard any American tell me we, as in immigrants, "owe them" for seeking a better life in America.
People have such hatred towards things they don't understand or that don't directly affect them. Try coming at it with compassion instead.

The only thing I've ever heard was "if you don't like America go back home". That's literally it. No "you owe us we saved your life" bs

No other teams in the NFL are so eager to get rid of young talent like the Eagles. On field coach, I like. Despise him as GM.
@JohnMiceli15 I'll have that eagles mock draft in tonight
Kelly is such a chubby little obnoxious know-it-all who wants all the attention and values playmakers so little. FUCK HIM

@PressSec : strike that killed hostages on compound in "remote" area of Afghanistan-Pakistan border; followed long surveillance #voaalert
White House not discussing or confirming reports that strike that killed hostages was a drone hit #voaalert
You gon make them eggs cheesey with them gritz or nah 🍳
@robweir I wonder if there is cost involved and that's why they don't use text alerts for news like they do with Twitter.
@PressSec says prior to strike, US intel had assessed compound where hostages were killed had been frequented by al Qaida leaders #voaalert
@JaclynGlenn this may hit a little too close to home for some people http://t.co/bcBUgGKsrV

MVP discussion just ended
@jruehartpiece didn't he make like 73/100 three pointers at practice? Although it was practice you can't sleep he's automatic
STEPH is straight going off right now
@jruehartpiece which is where everything starts. I mean he's on track to be the best shooter of all time
@JackieHotmai rt
@RJThaGURU @jruehartpiece that sounds more like it
I always root for the underdog but you can't just not acknowledge a player like Steph
Curry dad most b so damn proud
Eu acho q vou p o quintal e me cobrir com terra e fingir ser uma cenoura, melhor do q ficar sem fazer nada
Only true warriors fans are watching this game. Cuz I kno damn well they  left when they was down by 20.
@marcus_adams66 I love you Marcus but this all comes from your bias involving James harden
Everyone's getting their septums pierced
@LukeMillan1 just tweet "ball is life" &amp; people will love you.
@jruehartpiece then let's get off practice. Let's talk about how automatic his shot is at LITERALLY any given time. Guarded or unguarded
“@i_Vybe: K ci &amp; JoJo - All My Life: #PlayingNow on http://t.co/CovarRyOLz - Joel \"JoJo\" Hailey/Rory Bennett” Our Song? 😋
This year has taught me that I get annoyed very easily
@jruehartpiece and that's crazy he missed a 25th of shots at that particular practice and you think it's still gas 😂@marcus_adams66 I see I see
@jruehartpiece you're Wylin if anything it's James harden. Stephs off days are good games to most players
If curry don't win MVP. I'll b disgusted with the NBA
@jruehartpiece but that's not the point of the award. I agreed with that until end of February- mid March came around
Steph curry is filthy Mc nasty nuggets

@marcus_adams66 @jruehartpiece in agreeing with you

@T_Luts nigga yes you can. I see the logic but it's not that literal. You wouldn't be cocky if you played on the best team in the country?

My level of excitement for my teams from 1-10. Sixers: 9 Eagles: 6 Phillies: 3 Flyers: 3
My level of trust in my teams on a scale from 1-10. Sixers: 10 Flyers: 6.5 Eagles: 4 Phillies: 1.5
Level of desire for my teams to win a championship on scale from 1-10 Eagles: 10 Sixers: 10 Flyers: 9.5 Phillies: 9.2
My level of corniness and boredom in my last 3 tweets on a scale of 1-10. 100000000000My top 5 ranking of players I want the Sixers to get: Okafor-Towns-Russell-Mudiay-Hezonja
Sixers must offer Jimmy Butler &amp; Kawhi Leonard max contracts this off-season. If neither sign(which is the likely) then don't sign anyone.
Sixers are in a great position. If they fail to sign a top, young FA then just chill. Dont sign someone just for the sake of signing someone
Jonathan Papelbon is once again pitching like a top closer in baseball. This isn't a fluke folks. #futureHOF
