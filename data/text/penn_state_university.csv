@brettlive it's Mike Milbury. He doesn't know how to do better.
I don't partake in any pagan traditions or holidays that are based from nature people of Europe!
So Blessed to be a #Muslim 👍
Players Milbury traded away: Chara, Redden, Luongo, Olli Jokinen, Bertuzzi and Spezza. He also passed on Heatley and Gaborik in '00 draft.
Remember when Milbury traded Chara, second overall and another player for Alexei Yashin and then re-signed him for 10 years, $87.5 million?"@jessmohs: “@CuteEmergency: Happy Easter 🌸💙💗💜 http://t.co/jNKBNUGktt” @FaithCollum" oh my 😍😂😍being smart is cool but daylonging is cooler @ Pattee and Paterno Library https://t.co/cpfoZoNkDm

@kmart93 That's upsetting, but the Phillies are probably gonna lose 100 games. That's pretty depressing.
How long will it take before the Phillies win their first game of the season?
I mean, they're probably looking at two sweeps to start the season against Boston and Washington. Let's be honest.
Sick job today boys @Phillies #OpeningDayStop talkin' shit behind my back. Boy you should stop that. #ugh

That ball was CLEARLY off Duke. What's the point of replay if you're not gonna make the right call anyways
Apparently Coach K's check cleared at halftime...
Classic refs. Wisconsin wins by default.

@Caith02 is the best thought!@brettlive basically they're in unless they lose both games and Boston wins.
@brettlive same (see 2004 Super Bowl, 2011 Stanley cup playoffs)

Hard to believe this was the start of junior year and now we're so close to finishing our first year… https://t.co/g8iSgZnxXm@TomShakely @TheLION907fm There's nothing wrong with its programming, the station has had a lot of ups and downs in terms of mgmt &amp; funding
Hoosiers single and walk to put runners on 1st and 2nd with nobody out in the 4th. #WeAre #PennStateSB
Macy Jones' wild pitch sends the runners to 2nd and 3rd with nobody out.

@jake_abrams @TheLION907fm Yes it has. And I love the new physical plant. But new space is a separate story from mgmt/funding.
Hoosiers sac fly to right sends one runner home. IU leads 3-2. Runner on 3rd, 1 out.
@ola_obey @colton_miller_ yes. It looks like you were edited in
Indiana's RBI single extends the Hoosier lead to 4-2 with 1 out in the 4th. #WeAre #PennStateSB

@jake_abrams @TheLION907fm In other words: I would've liked to see story about "how/why did this new studio happen" rather than...
@TomShakely @TheLION907fm well the story was a profile of the station. The new space was included to reinforce their goals to rebrand.
@jake_abrams @TheLION907fm ...implication new space is result of changed operational structure/funding resolution, neither of which are new.
#HappyNationalSiblingDay to the sister/brother that I probably was separated from from birth. Keep doin you 😕T4: Hoosiers 2-run homer to deep center makes the Penn State deficit 6-2. 2 out. #WeAre #PennStateSB

@sexuaI @taraamh 😑😒
Naming your son "Guy" is cheating.
Sedentarys are the little cutesy relationships we get in inbetween, we practice what we learned from the progresser, and eventually move on
At the end you make your final commitment with your companion, this is a combination of both the progresser and the sedentary
@ASAPBullwinkle yeah I wonder if they're gonna stick with it anyway or not I mean that could still be happening

So I needed to buy a suit for weddings I am going to with my girlfriend.
Went to Men's Warehouse first and they where trying to sell me an 800 dollar suit in a buy one get one sale.
I'm not Ric Flair, I need one suitEnded up at Macy's with a lady that's been fitting suits for 15+ years, sized me up just by looking at me (I had my measurements on me)
To be clear this lady looked at me and made excellent estimates, seasoned pro.
Great deal, buy the whole set up on my Macy's card. I'm thrilled...can't really beat @Macys
End up calling my Mom, I always take her advice on fashion stuff. She has a great eye for colors and prints.
Mom offers to buy the suit, I'm like "hey, I can actually afford this on my card so that's cool."
Then she's like "Well I'll buy your shoes" and I'm actually pretty deep in dress shoes.
Mom doesn't even validate that with a response.
"Mom, I'm good on dress shoes. If you really want to help me out you could get me Mortal Kombat" @NetherRealm
My mom loves me enough to help me buy a new suit but can't be bothered to help me tear superfluous wholes in ninjas' chests.@jessiccalynnn ☺️😘Seriously this woman is trying to have Mr.Peabody put down (executed) for biting her.
Watching Mr Peabody and Sherman the movie. I think we'd need some serious laws in place to protect the rights of sentient genius animals.
The mutha fucka won a Nobel Prize in their world and you want to execute him?
Seriously this dog can build a time machine and they're trying to say he can't be a father.
Mr. Peabody could probably make a handy dandy mass euthanasia machine and kill all of his doubters/rivals
But he doesn't, he's cool like that. He just wants to take Sherman on educational adventures through time.Pagi2 dah buat gua naik hangin. Tak klakar doh

Emotional roller coaster
@CECH_it_out  https://t.co/QNsIUq2TO0whats up twitterHow far has our society sunk that we must educate young men that sexual assault/rape is wrong? Common sense is not a common virtue.
college had me like http://t.co/3GjX67nGg1
@JimmyKempski i am all about goodley thatd be cool
I find calls for PSU to educate students, faculty that it's wrong to rape pathetic. What have their parents been teaching them? COMMON SENSE
We are in trouble if we have to spend time explaining to adults sexual assault/rape are wrong. Is this going to be a freshman seminar?
I’ve got a half-baked idea of reviewing #sra111 research videos using only emoji. Could that be a thing?you guys, donkey kong 64 is on VC
I don't need a class to know rape is wrong, but I do now because of Sandusky. I object to it and find it demeaning.

For a ring to propose
They've been raving about RB Nick Scott...see why after 51-yard TD run #BlueWhite2015
" I'm not Amish , I just think you're cute"
Nick Scott just provided the highlight of the blue - white gane, or any game for that matter with a 51-yard td run
Scott should have been trapped in the backfield but kept his balance and broke three tackle attempts along the way vs. First team defense

Congrats girl! Can't wait for you to be here!!RT "@katyrupp: Officially a Penn State cheerleader... #SoHappy #WeAre 💙
It's time for some hockey!!!!!!! #Pens #LetsGoPens
If there's any place that's right Tebow it's with the Eagles. Great system but will he be able to beat out Bradford or Sanchez. Doubtful.
On NFL Live Trey Wingo claimed that if Bill Belichick couldn't get the most out of Tim Tebow how will Chip Kelly.
At that point where I basically hate everyone aka I need a break

Vegetables and alcohol have a lot in common. They are both only consumed for their effects, not from their enjoyment of taste.
Apparently for me to have a crush on a woman, she has to be either (a) married/in a relationship; (b) too different in age to easily date; &gt;
@jennazavian worth it doeeee
@jordfick She was the only choice, really with Oprah out of the prime time game. Besides she got Lance.
@KingJelani__ sir u don't see that obvious lump in her neck
