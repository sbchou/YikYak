Things in Lexington in area around UK Campus really getting set on fire now according to scanner. Obviously EVERYONE has now heard the news
Was quiet for a while around the UK Campus but things are SUPER hot on the scanner now as far as fires and all in areas surrounding it
Listening to Lexington Fire Scanner. Things getting Red Hot Now! Everything on fire! Even sounds like  firefighter is in middle of angry mob
So its Opening Day now. 

And let's just say, uh... White Sox goin to the 'ship y'all. 

Because we all have hope during the opening week.
I think this firefighter could be in middle of angry mob, because I can here the sounds of people screaming and yelling in the background
"@PLewbel: Arrest count now up to 6 here on State St as another fire starts off in distance http://t.co/5prI5PzOPF" CORRECTION: In Lexington

Keep the pace badgers

In this game Okafor looks like the entire IU team against Syracuse in the sweet 16...2 years back. That is not a compliment.

@PeytonsHead @BobsFunGirl the weather in Indy is also always amazing when hosting a major event
BS call
SWORD FIGHTTTTTTTTTT
That was easily off duke
Ballgame
DAGGGGGGGGGGER
Referees turned this game into an absolute joke
I understand why everyone hates Kentucky, the Patriots and all of those guys. But outside of winning what has Duke done to make #HatersHate
How was that not off his finger...
Refs are petty üòí
@Mr__Wheeler I'd rather have Badgers than Satan in a costume
How do you miss that call?
If Wisconsin loses that will be considered #thetip
You could legit see his finger bend. How is that duke ball get rid of the replay review if you can't fucking open your eyes
@therealjuicyJ85 aww thanks so much Joe!!! and will do hahaha
I guess Indy did not even give the refs a 720p resolution monitor because everyone saw Winslow tip that ball
Wisconsin's maturity is showing right now, pretty impressive responseReal sports don't have timeouts.  Oh soccer and Formula 1?  Just a coincidence
Can't live here anymore. My dryer breaking down is to much for me to handle. And it reeks of burnt popcorn. #help
OK, not saying this hasn't been a great game, but ... combined layups missed?
This is why people hate Duke.
@DrewHarvey17 agreed. A lot of bad calls and a lot of bad missed calls.
Coach K look like a mouse you can't lie
Just remember how that game ended. Shouldn't have went that way.
Duke has now won 3 of their 5 National Titles in Indianapolis.
At least it wasn't Kentucky.
#THETIP
Once again this is why people hate Duke. They are a great team but that seriously was fucking bullshit üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fuck Duke
Dukeee
Well at least IU can't brag about being the only one with 5 banners anymore.....
Hey we'll see ya, Wisconsin‚úåÔ∏è
I hate Duke. So much.
@Young_Cobb ALWAYS
That was the saddest Tellytubby I've ever seen
@crimsonquarry and all 5 of theirs are after the last IU title...
So sad for Wisconsin
That was seriously a great game though. Duke was down 9 and pulled that off. Tough lose for the Wisco boys though
At least Jim Delaney found new refs tonight: Can't get a call right even when it is obvious on the monitor
That's too bad, Wisconsin played their ‚ù§Ô∏è's out, would have been nice to see a different team win for once. #FinalFourChampionship
@BigJah15 won a high school chip last year and won a national chip this year.
@DrewHarvey17 yeah that ball with 2 min left was clearly off Winslow, even with review they missed it. That's hard to explain
Relax people! There were calls that went both ways all game. So don't blame the loss on the finger tip out of bounds call. Duke won fair!
Well at least Kentucky didn't win. I can respect a program like Duke winning it over a "program" that Classless-pari put together...
Sports man.... :/
Since high school, I've been really able to appreciate what Coach K has done for this game. Great coaching. #AlwaysAHeelThough
Kentucky players are at home knowing they could have smacked Duke.
Coach K lowkey schemed during that halftime to get that call. SMH.@The_Kid_4 yeet
Sure the refs missed a couple calls. But the refs didn't let a white freshman score 8 straight points on them. #GraysonAllen
"@BarstoolPurdue: RT "@cait_pat: Ohio State has football, Wisconsin almost had basketball, Purdue has Harry's""  hahaha

Only explanation for that call is @UKCoachCalipari paid the refs in advance and they gave the blue team the win. That's gotta be it üòÇüíÅ

If a true democracy forms that doesn't follow neoliberal path of privatize everything, the West destroys it (Britain/US v Mossedegh, Iran).

This has gone the same way for 7 years. She isn't going to change. I'm not willing to overlook the obvious disaster a r'ship w her would be.
Bottom line, she's not being honest with herself and keeps waiting for someone to "bail her life out".

BREAKING: Father of twins killed in fire sentenced to 70 years: http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ http://t.co/bodri3Wmz0
I like thunderstorms and everything but not when they wake me up at 6 amThe 32-year-old was sentenced to 66 years in prison, 4 years probation. http://t.co/vnnW5uNnC5
"This is certainly a heartbreaking case," Tippecanoe Superior Court 2 Judge Steven Meyer told the defendant. @jconline
Dad said he tried to save his sons. "And I believe you believe that," judge said.
"I think this will haunt you for the rest of your life," judge told Brandon Abbott during sentencing: http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ
Detective Matthew Couch, TCSO, testified that he found ruptured propane tank near source of house fire that killed twin 3-year-olds.
Multiple propane tanks found in home believed to be used to smoke "dab," a waxy marijuana extract. Home filled with drug paraphernalia.
Mother of twins killed in fire: "Granddads should never outlive their grandkids." http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ @jconline
"I would have died to save my kids," twins' mother added, noting that their father kept partying after the fire until his arrest.
I updated my phone but I still don't have the new emojis?????
Defense attorney Thomas O'Brien argued that Brandon Abbott isn't the worst of the worst: "He didn't intentionally try to hurt his children."
I have the slowest computer at work and it's super annoying

@untimelygamer A lot of this one does, too. Most big games have slick marketing, and many have buggy early access. What's different about SC

@JlnFrancisco @BootlegGirl Indeed. I'm an Indiana voter and I doubt my state is in play. There's certainly less "protest vote risk"
@JlnFrancisco @BootlegGirl Protest votes might not make much difference but you can bet the GOP wants a low turnout.
@lois_foster Yes, we know him.  A good friend's dad. they need to hand it over to the State Police.

@swizzard I dunno if someone whose actionable plan for better candidates is ???? can really talk, do you?
@swizzard So your solution is therefore either give up, or start the revolution. Good luck with that?
@swizzard Dream candidate? I'm no fan of HC. I just see your position as about as grounded in possibility as RW secessionist rhetoric.@swizzard I don't think there are dream candidates. If the left hasn't disposed of that fantasy after Obama though, nothing will.

"Political correctness" is tearing this nation down. A person can't say 5 words without offending someone, pretty ridiculous

@foresmac @moonshinemason hell yes
@francisevan10 yeah man that's just really cool. I don't think I could have survived without knowing this
And yeah the line to Frankfort is straight because I cheated and used a power line.

Well, that was an interesting convo with Q right there with interesting comments.......
Q when asked wgy Crawford was pulled: "I didn't like the goals we gave up there amd we needed it to give us some momentum."
I stand corrected. The Pacers are not fatigued, and playing at a fast pace in the Grindhouse. I like it!
GAHHHHHH METAL!!!! Hoss off the Crossbar and had Rinne beat! So close to tying things up!why doesn't @SoundCloud use a timeline or go by most played? I hate scrolling to find new music on artist profiles

Pacers gave it a good run, but ran out of gas tonight &amp; have to settle for the Lottery. Lose 95-83 to Memphis. Nets claim Final Spot in East
Meanwhile in Nashville, 80 MINUTES is not enough! We are heading to DOUBLE OT in Game 1! Hawks and Preds still tied 3-3
I get so disappointed when all I look forward to at night is watching forensic files and they are all repeats...come on really?!!!

It may Only have been Game 1, but this is a Demoralizing loss for Nashville: You are up 3-0 after one period and lose 4-3 on Home Ice! OUCH!

@CoachQsMustache Why did Coach play Crawford tonight? Darling's beard was better
DAMN IT Q I AM REALLY PISSED OFF NOW!!!! ANOTHER GOAL!!!! WTF WERE YOU THINKING TONIGHT PLAYING CRAWFORD?!?!?! YOU IDIOT!!!!
Crawford has to go...
This inexplicable thought which has been growing inside me. I dont want just anyone to know just anything about me. Step 1: minimal snapchat
DAMN IT Q!!!! I AM OFFICIQLLY PISSED OFF AT THE STACHE!!!!
Don't know much about hockey but 95% sure the proper way to play goalie isn't to watch the puck go in the goal.
So did the Blackhawks forget how to play or.....@CoachQsMustache I am VERY angry at the Stache right now! Why is Darling not playing instwad of Crawford?
@eefranke is a psycho bitch.
@CoachQsMustache We must play better Sunday. Our coach has a stache. We are supposed to be the better team!

@BootlegGirl Something RLM points out that I can't shake is how Coruscant doesn't seem to be impacted by war at all.
@Nomnomqondiso that butters over thar?
@pnayder I never said you did. His play, says he belong. That was my point. Sitting Crow just might wake him up, if Darling plays well.
@BootlegGirl This is what I mean when I say I'd have gone back to the drawing board. Big time.
@BootlegGirl Which should have inoculated them from social collapse. Which is why the war shouldn't have been fought with clones and robots.
I feel so awfuljust washed my hair in the kitchen sink bc I'm that lazy of a bitch üíÅ #treatyoself
http://t.co/SupU9Zxo5d
@pnayder For the record too, I love Crow and yes the D has been bad all yr. That's why I like Darling right now. He is out playing Crow now.
Joe is telling the hockey puck story AGAIN
@limenale @BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime Gotta skip the part where he's a kid then. Anakin in ep1 barely has the agency to be good or bad.
@limenale @BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime Then I'd probly have the Jedi be the ones who ruined Anakin/Padme, not Anakin bein a creep.
@pnayder Here is something we can both agree on. We both love the @NHLBlackhawks  and want them to win the Stanley Cup, PERIOD!!
And off to work on a rainy day. #wemaybetakingporo #nobiggie
@missdysko A stunning white girl üëå
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime up until his fall, for which the Jedi are responsible.
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime I'd rather place the blame for Anakin's fall on the Jedi than Anakin. Lets us root for Anakin right
happy birthday @FawnDorr. enjoy üíô
@caraaaaaa üíÄüíÄ
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime Like maybe: Jedi against Padme/Anakin so they send Anakin to the frontier of the fighting. +@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime so instead of a bullshit pregnancy subplot to shoehorn in Luke/Leia, Anakin has real reason to be mad
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime while Anakin is gone, Padme dies in some other battle Anakin would have been there for +

@PokemonyeWest @sluttynature hit me, what's your height?
Tonight has been my livest night on Twitter. Idk if that's good or bad but it didn't involve drake (much) so im growing I guess
