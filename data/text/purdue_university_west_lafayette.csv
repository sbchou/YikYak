@MarkAHeinold hey Wisconsin won. You probably know that!
This is shades of UNLV and Tark the Shark getting upset by Duke in 1991. Only exception now is more games are played.
they gone be back tho. ✊ #BBN
@tmacc_17 unfortunately that made my day, sort of haha.
@BronchoAD @pleaf85 @bronchobball not if duke wins

@BronchoAD @pleaf85 @bronchobball ohhhhh I see how it is
@KStephens_21 great game.  Happy to see the #B1G represented well! #BoilerUp
they gone be even better with @_IsaiahBriscoe coming to #BBN
I'm here for all the drake shade.
The only bad thing about the Wisconsin win is IU people still get to hold onto the last undefeated season claim. #BoilerUp
"@IBall4Fun_12: “@JaySimpson_23: B1G basketball is the best!!” THE BEST!" for sure! #B1G
@caseywolfschlag They didn't cheat. They Coach jus know how to scout and get talented players

"@SethDavisHoops: Badgers have to put the euphoria of this win behind them pretty quick. Postgame now on TBS." Truth! #BeatDuke #B1G
Reports are out that #Calipari will not play any BigTen teams at a neutral site in #Indiana .. you're running out of gyms Cal #Kentucky

Kentucky proved over the last 2 games that had they been in the ACC or Big10 they would not have been undefeated.@tmacc_17 remind me to bring my sunscreen 😉
@DrewHarvey17 haha that is true. IU and Purdue rivalry is like brothers fighting. Kentucky is just an Indiana school's worst enemy
I guess what #Calipari was referring to as making history this season was... Winning an SEC Conference championship. Nobody has done that b4
@DrewHarvey17 I actually did want to see that game, to see Hammons match up with them and Purdue probably could have kept it close 4 a while
people irritate me 😤
@tmacc_17 thank you and gracias!!
@DrewHarvey17 and honestly I did not want to see this year's IU team play that Kentucky team haha

Things in Lexington in area around UK Campus really getting set on fire now according to scanner. Obviously EVERYONE has now heard the news
Was quiet for a while around the UK Campus but things are SUPER hot on the scanner now as far as fires and all in areas surrounding it
Listening to Lexington Fire Scanner. Things getting Red Hot Now! Everything on fire! Even sounds like  firefighter is in middle of angry mob
So its Opening Day now. 

And let's just say, uh... White Sox goin to the 'ship y'all. 

Because we all have hope during the opening week.
I think this firefighter could be in middle of angry mob, because I can here the sounds of people screaming and yelling in the background
"@PLewbel: Arrest count now up to 6 here on State St as another fire starts off in distance http://t.co/5prI5PzOPF" CORRECTION: In Lexington
@tmacc_17 alright alright I'll take your word for it!There is a State Street in Madison that runs in the vicinity of the Wisconsin Campus which is why I was confused
I mean if you think about it, Harrison's comment about Kaminsky is really a compliment to a white bball player. #AndrewHarrison #Kaminsky
Lexington Fire: Another fire in Middle of Street near UK Campus according to firefighter in middle of angry crowd. Wants response.
“@JosinaAnderson: Time to go to bed. ✌️"@FrankieVtotheD: You know what Frank Kaminsky says to Andrew Harrison? https://t.co/h5teLQ1apA”” WON

Seems to be a lot of lacerations happening to people in this angry crowd of UK Students@PLewbel That explains the Lacerations I keep hearing about on the scanner

@Anne_Halliwell @KyKernel That helps to lighten the mood somewhat. Makes things less hostile@BoilerSandy Yep. Sounds like things are calming down though and mood is changing because someone is bringing a boombox through the crowd
Sounds like things in Lexington are FINALLY settling down drastically. Probably of to bed soon....
"@Anne_Halliwell: Man tosses flaming material up, police move in. #statestreet @KyKernel http://t.co/miMudn9pIq" Uh Oh! BIG No No
@BoilerSandy Unfortunately I can only listen to fire and EMS. Police isn't available

@MartySmithESPN Well, I guess if you can't get close to put the fire out because everyone is hostile and might harm you, that works

Can't wait to be 21 and finally be able to go enjoy my evenings with all my friends rather than sit at home bored
@msnewbootayy OMG.....Everytime I see you I still get that wow thought and those butterflies in my stomach
When in doubt, puke and rally #OnWisconsin #WhereElse
I  am secretly cheering for Duke right now, what kind of BigTen fan am I?? Oh yeah that's right... I'm not a Purdue fan... #B1GMBB #Duke
@meghanyoung @amymasson @EdCates haha.  Right?!
@hhhhannah_ us 😂 https://t.co/dBlzi6HBHz
Great, now really can't focus on this paper.Totally rooting for my fellow big ten team
Ain't nothin but a chicken wing. 

Because they don't call that a foul these days folks.
A lot of people said Wisco only won because they played out of their minds on Saturday....well they've been unconscious for &lt;3 games now
Keep the pace badgers
Wisconsin for the win!
wiz Khalifa and Charlie puths song see you again that was MEANT TO NOT MAKE THE AUDIENCE SAD did exactly the opposite tbh that music vid 😭
Grayson Allen putting da team on his back doe
#ismelllikepureglorybishizzz - @njcrobinson1999
Duke looks so bad outside of this Allen kid. Like they look really bad outside of him.
Well Grayson Allen is good
This game is a huge stride forward for white people in basketball #WhiteLivesMatter
FUCK DUKE AND WISCONSIN CANT STAND EITHER TEAM
#1 reason Indiana is the worst: traffic at 11 PM

Can't wrap my head around the idea that Game of Thrones will be back in less than a week
@smitsy16 GOOD
Kaminsky is a savage
I know okafor is amazing but Kaminsky is taking him to school. GETTING DESTROYED.
Wisconsin is looking pretty good tho
In this game Okafor looks like the entire IU team against Syracuse in the sweet 16...2 years back. That is not a compliment.
Decidedly pro-Wisconsin (and/or anti-Duke) crowd at Chumley's tonight.
My goal is to get to a Wednesday Night Jam before the end of the semester.

Hey Duke-em or whatever your name is. Don't talk to a guy 3 times better than you bro. Don't be like Andrew Harrison.I'm only rooting for Duke simply because. "The B1G is tough." And all the Badgers in Lucas Oil are acting like Taylor Swift right meow.
(Wisc-behind the back-nothin but net)
Announcers: 3 for Wisc
(Duke makes a layup)
Announcers: what a team-so aggressive. Guys are winners.
Teaching sean how to twatter.
“@tbhjuststop: never let a boy treat u like a purple jolly rancher bc ur a blue one” purples actually v good the green one sucks
@EmilyRosann I hate your header so much
When you find out your perfect prom dress was ordered off of a sketchy scam website so youre really sad. #relatable
This Allen kid is the best player on the court right meow and you have the top two players from this year playing tonight
This game 👀
@nataliejasinski omg lol
@HammerAndRails bruuuuuh they didn't even make it out of the first round of 64 😅
I named my bracket after Grayson Allen for a reason. Glad he's helping to make it exciting again
I'm just a fan of this Allen kid, and have a lot of respect for Coach K.Well, my power nap turned into a two-hour nap, and college is kicking our butts so @insomniacookies is saving our lives.
OKAFOR JUST TOLD TWITTER TO HUSHHHHH
BO RYAN BE BO CRYIN! Good coach, but man up bruhhhhhh.
DUKE
@PeytonsHead @BobsFunGirl the weather in Indy is also always amazing when hosting a major event
BS call
SWORD FIGHTTTTTTTTTT
That was easily off duke
Ballgame
DAGGGGGGGGGGER
Referees turned this game into an absolute joke
I understand why everyone hates Kentucky, the Patriots and all of those guys. But outside of winning what has Duke done to make #HatersHate
How was that not off his finger...
Refs are petty 😒
@Mr__Wheeler I'd rather have Badgers than Satan in a costume
How do you miss that call?
If Wisconsin loses that will be considered #thetip
You could legit see his finger bend. How is that duke ball get rid of the replay review if you can't fucking open your eyes
@therealjuicyJ85 aww thanks so much Joe!!! and will do hahaha
I guess Indy did not even give the refs a 720p resolution monitor because everyone saw Winslow tip that ball
Wisconsin's maturity is showing right now, pretty impressive responseReal sports don't have timeouts.  Oh soccer and Formula 1?  Just a coincidence
Can't live here anymore. My dryer breaking down is to much for me to handle. And it reeks of burnt popcorn. #help
OK, not saying this hasn't been a great game, but ... combined layups missed?
This is why people hate Duke.
@DrewHarvey17 agreed. A lot of bad calls and a lot of bad missed calls.
Coach K look like a mouse you can't lie
Just remember how that game ended. Shouldn't have went that way.
Duke has now won 3 of their 5 National Titles in Indianapolis.
At least it wasn't Kentucky.
#THETIP
Once again this is why people hate Duke. They are a great team but that seriously was fucking bullshit 😂😂😂
Fuck Duke
Dukeee
Well at least IU can't brag about being the only one with 5 banners anymore.....
Hey we'll see ya, Wisconsin✌️
I hate Duke. So much.
@Young_Cobb ALWAYS
That was the saddest Tellytubby I've ever seen
@crimsonquarry and all 5 of theirs are after the last IU title...
So sad for Wisconsin
That was seriously a great game though. Duke was down 9 and pulled that off. Tough lose for the Wisco boys though
At least Jim Delaney found new refs tonight: Can't get a call right even when it is obvious on the monitor
That's too bad, Wisconsin played their ❤️'s out, would have been nice to see a different team win for once. #FinalFourChampionship
@BigJah15 won a high school chip last year and won a national chip this year.
@DrewHarvey17 yeah that ball with 2 min left was clearly off Winslow, even with review they missed it. That's hard to explain
Relax people! There were calls that went both ways all game. So don't blame the loss on the finger tip out of bounds call. Duke won fair!
Well at least Kentucky didn't win. I can respect a program like Duke winning it over a "program" that Classless-pari put together...
Sports man.... :/
Since high school, I've been really able to appreciate what Coach K has done for this game. Great coaching. #AlwaysAHeelThough
Kentucky players are at home knowing they could have smacked Duke.
Coach K lowkey schemed during that halftime to get that call. SMH.@The_Kid_4 yeet
Sure the refs missed a couple calls. But the refs didn't let a white freshman score 8 straight points on them. #GraysonAllen
"@BarstoolPurdue: RT "@cait_pat: Ohio State has football, Wisconsin almost had basketball, Purdue has Harry's""  hahaha
@stcatron35 I completely agree with that, but Wisconsin did that a lot this season too.
What. A. Game!! 🏀🙌🏀  Best part? Watching with my favorite basketball player @matt_rumpke #30 #fam #bballmom
Shoot  Ohio State would have beat Duke. @OhioStAthletics
@K_breezy24 bandwagon
@K_breezy24 fair weather
NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD IU IS GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR AND GET PUMPED FOR THE SWEET 16!!! #HOOHOOHOOHOOSIERS 
#CANTWAIT
Only explanation for that call is @UKCoachCalipari paid the refs in advance and they gave the blue team the win. That's gotta be it 😂💁
@alyssaa_smith you look so pretty in your prof pic lyss!
Michigan winning it next year #GoBlue
@K_breezy24 you goin to Duke next year bro??

Of course they put the hot UCLA cheerleader in the #OneShiningMoment

ALL war is merely fight by power/privilege seeking to maintain or expand their power/privilege. True of West, true of ME.it's 7:30 &amp; chuy and i are both in line at McDonald's 😂
When West goes to war, says it's to "protect" or "spread democracy". No. It's to spread neoliberal econ = increase power/privilege for few.Think about it. West "spreading democracy" NEVER focused on actual democracy. Focus ALWAYS on econ policies FIRST. Set those in stone.
If a true democracy forms that doesn't follow neoliberal path of privatize everything, the West destroys it (Britain/US v Mossedegh, Iran).

I used to be attracted to women I thought I could "help". Figured out I need to use that time to work on "me". It's helped.  #singlelifeI'm not a cheerleader. I don't have all the answers.  I keep telling her that; it's like she doesn't believe me. She needs to do the work.
This has gone the same way for 7 years. She isn't going to change. I'm not willing to overlook the obvious disaster a r'ship w her would be.
Bottom line, she's not being honest with herself and keeps waiting for someone to "bail her life out".

BREAKING: Father of twins killed in fire sentenced to 70 years: http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ http://t.co/bodri3Wmz0
I like thunderstorms and everything but not when they wake me up at 6 amThe 32-year-old was sentenced to 66 years in prison, 4 years probation. http://t.co/vnnW5uNnC5
"This is certainly a heartbreaking case," Tippecanoe Superior Court 2 Judge Steven Meyer told the defendant. @jconline
Dad said he tried to save his sons. "And I believe you believe that," judge said.
"I think this will haunt you for the rest of your life," judge told Brandon Abbott during sentencing: http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ
Detective Matthew Couch, TCSO, testified that he found ruptured propane tank near source of house fire that killed twin 3-year-olds.
Multiple propane tanks found in home believed to be used to smoke "dab," a waxy marijuana extract. Home filled with drug paraphernalia.
Mother of twins killed in fire: "Granddads should never outlive their grandkids." http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ @jconline
"I would have died to save my kids," twins' mother added, noting that their father kept partying after the fire until his arrest.
I updated my phone but I still don't have the new emojis?????
Defense attorney Thomas O'Brien argued that Brandon Abbott isn't the worst of the worst: "He didn't intentionally try to hurt his children."
I have the slowest computer at work and it's super annoying
Happy birthday to my girl @itsmeleighton ❤️🎉🎉
Court noted that plea agreement means Abbott waived his right to appeal. http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJ
Deputy Prosecutor Jessica Paxson moved to dismiss all the drug charges brought against Abbott. http://t.co/S02tPmYhNJIf you don't have the update, black emojis are just white emojis with an alien next to them. Who thought that was a good idea?

@JlnFrancisco @BootlegGirl Indeed. I'm an Indiana voter and I doubt my state is in play. There's certainly less "protest vote risk"
@JlnFrancisco @BootlegGirl Protest votes might not make much difference but you can bet the GOP wants a low turnout.
@lois_foster Yes, we know him.  A good friend's dad. they need to hand it over to the State Police.
@BootlegGirl @MetroidThief Elizabeth Warren is also on the wrong side (for the left, at least) of the Palestine issue so...@BasebaIIVines that frame job tho 😲😮
@BootlegGirl @MetroidThief Granted she's on the same side as Hillary Clinton so that particular issue is a wash.

@funkatron @ddemerly .... uh, wrong response, Ed.  Or rather, incomplete response.  You forgot the part about the importance of GRADUATING!
@swizzard I dunno if someone whose actionable plan for better candidates is ???? can really talk, do you?
@swizzard So your solution is therefore either give up, or start the revolution. Good luck with that?
@swizzard Dream candidate? I'm no fan of HC. I just see your position as about as grounded in possibility as RW secessionist rhetoric.@swizzard I don't think there are dream candidates. If the left hasn't disposed of that fantasy after Obama though, nothing will.

I really really hate that someone has traumatized me to the point that being in the same room as them destroys me.
now I'm stuck in my shit like I sit in cow manure.

Where is Aaron Hernandez? I don't see him in the courtroom! Why was he cufded, shackled, and led away before he could hear Odin Lloyd's fam?
He would know. He went there and afterwards really cleaned up his life. Hernandez doesn't have that chance https://t.co/RVpffbPXUV

Happy Birthday To Me 🎉🎋 finally a dub 😉
@jesslazarz your father is a very smart man
Pacers gave it a good run, but ran out of gas tonight &amp; have to settle for the Lottery. Lose 95-83 to Memphis. Nets claim Final Spot in East
Meanwhile in Nashville, 80 MINUTES is not enough! We are heading to DOUBLE OT in Game 1! Hawks and Preds still tied 3-3
I get so disappointed when all I look forward to at night is watching forensic files and they are all repeats...come on really?!!!
Happy birthday to my spirit animal!! @_vula I'm your number one fan. Can't wait for you to drive me around when I'm home. LOVE U SO MUCH❤️❤️
DOUBLE OT is about to begin! #CHIvsNSH #StanleyCup #BecauseItsTheCup
Vula's birthday or national holiday??
@RSJ_24 thanks 😁😁😁
@TheRealDiabeto #gorangersgo
And the Puck has been dropped and the 2nd OT is underway...... #CHIvsNSH #StanleyCup #BecauseItsTheCup
@_LanceDawg thanks girl appreciate it 😘Many hockey fans in the Sun Belt are called fair weather, but it is after Midnight in Nashville now and it appears NO ONE has left
Well, this Hawks game won't feel good at school tomorrow
Taylor L'Huillier is seriously one of the coolest, most fun girls I have ever met and anyone who doesn't see that is missing out. Love her.
Genuinely being disappointed in some people that I thought so highly of before is such a heart breaking feeling.
"Quit bitchin about life and keep drinking!" - wise words from my stepdad@taylorlhuillier always lovely. 💞 you know I'd do anything for you!
If anyone ever tried to hurt @brooke_lakin I'd use the killing curse on them. #AvedaKedavra
Boom
Keith!!!! Thank you! Now I can go to bed a happy Hawks fan
SCOOOOOREEEE!!!! DUNCAN KEITH ENDS IT 7:49 INTO 2ND OT!!!! HAWKS WIN HAWKS WIN!!!!
#Blackhawks come back from 3-0 down to beat the #Preds 4-3 and Take Game 1 in Double OT on Duncan Keith Goal. #StanleyCup
So I decided to go to bed at midnight and then proceeded to start a movie.@BallGame_SWISH thanks 😁

Excuse my French but this shits dead. I'm over it for real. It isn't worth it I promise you that.
It may Only have been Game 1, but this is a Demoralizing loss for Nashville: You are up 3-0 after one period and lose 4-3 on Home Ice! OUCH!
And the Calgary #Flames just STOLE Game 1 In Vancouver winning 2-1 on a Goal with 29.6 Secs left. #BecauseItsTheCup #StanleyCup
Two exams for the week done with and I'm still spending all night in a library...

@CoachQsMustache Why did Coach play Crawford tonight? Darling's beard was better
DAMN IT Q I AM REALLY PISSED OFF NOW!!!! ANOTHER GOAL!!!! WTF WERE YOU THINKING TONIGHT PLAYING CRAWFORD?!?!?! YOU IDIOT!!!!
Crawford has to go...
This inexplicable thought which has been growing inside me. I dont want just anyone to know just anything about me. Step 1: minimal snapchat
DAMN IT Q!!!! I AM OFFICIQLLY PISSED OFF AT THE STACHE!!!!
Don't know much about hockey but 95% sure the proper way to play goalie isn't to watch the puck go in the goal.
So did the Blackhawks forget how to play or.....@CoachQsMustache I am VERY angry at the Stache right now! Why is Darling not playing instwad of Crawford?
@eefranke is a psycho bitch.
@CoachQsMustache We must play better Sunday. Our coach has a stache. We are supposed to be the better team!

This can't be my last Grand Prix this can't be my last Grand Prix this can't be my last grand prix 😭@Omorka Lotsa folks make the same mistake liberals/leftists made in the 20s: Dismissing fascism as a tool/manifestation of capital.
Everything about Thomas Rhett 😍
@Omorka When it was a truly syncretic movement drawing from populism, socialism, racism, nationalism, militarism, and romanticism.
Can't wait for @GameOfThrones tonight! #TheHouseofBlackAndWhite #ValarMorghulis #jaqenh'ghar
@TedBear34 Why not!! Crawford has not been at his best as of late. Darling has played better then him.
@pnayder Crow has been iffy as of late. Darling is playing really well right now. Darling is the best chance to win today.
@BootlegGirl Bleh if I was gonna write on the prequels I'd scrap almost everything actually in them as Step 1.
@BootlegGirl The list of characters I'd even keep would be really, really short.
@Omorka Context would matter a lot. Fascia were also built into a lot of American neo-classical stuff.

@Omorka Well in American neo-classical context it would symbolize the authority of the rule of law, iirc. My art history is p. basic.
Made it through winter without getting sick, at least.
@BootlegGirl The focus would have been completely different, focused on the eroding structures of the Republic/Jedi.
@BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime If it were me, Anakin would not have been a main character. Probably not even Obi-wan.
Time to ball out for the next 17 days

@BootlegGirl Something RLM points out that I can't shake is how Coruscant doesn't seem to be impacted by war at all.
@Nomnomqondiso that butters over thar?
@pnayder I never said you did. His play, says he belong. That was my point. Sitting Crow just might wake him up, if Darling plays well.
@BootlegGirl This is what I mean when I say I'd have gone back to the drawing board. Big time.
@BootlegGirl Which should have inoculated them from social collapse. Which is why the war shouldn't have been fought with clones and robots.
I feel so awfuljust washed my hair in the kitchen sink bc I'm that lazy of a bitch 💁 #treatyoself

@pnayder For the record too, I love Crow and yes the D has been bad all yr. That's why I like Darling right now. He is out playing Crow now.
Joe is telling the hockey puck story AGAIN
@limenale @BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime Gotta skip the part where he's a kid then. Anakin in ep1 barely has the agency to be good or bad.
@limenale @BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime Then I'd probly have the Jedi be the ones who ruined Anakin/Padme, not Anakin bein a creep.
@pnayder Here is something we can both agree on. We both love the @NHLBlackhawks  and want them to win the Stanley Cup, PERIOD!!
And off to work on a rainy day. #wemaybetakingporo #nobiggie
@missdysko A stunning white girl 👌
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime up until his fall, for which the Jedi are responsible.
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime I'd rather place the blame for Anakin's fall on the Jedi than Anakin. Lets us root for Anakin right
happy birthday @FawnDorr. enjoy 💙
@caraaaaaa 💀💀
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime Like maybe: Jedi against Padme/Anakin so they send Anakin to the frontier of the fighting. +@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime so instead of a bullshit pregnancy subplot to shoehorn in Luke/Leia, Anakin has real reason to be mad
@BootlegGirl @limenale @WestCoastAnime while Anakin is gone, Padme dies in some other battle Anakin would have been there for +

Maybe Luke fans and miranda fans will get along since it's clear Luke and miranda are getting along? Probably not.

Why on earth are the #Eagles signing Tim Tebow? They are just going to suck more now! He also NEVER went to Oregon.....
@RonIsAwesome7 Thanks! http://t.co/jQk1Pkgxnj
@BoilerSandy @SInow It is. @AdamSchefter Reported it
@Mak140Mike that's the problem. He doesn't want to play a diff position other than QB. Part of the reason Pats organization let him go.
In case you don't believe the Tebow Story, here is the word from the Horse's Mouth, aka Original Source https://t.co/nx8sWnL6xB
Wait, was prom yesterday?
Band on the Run 👍👍

Knowing some Latin makes King Arthur so much more enjoyable. 👑
@Firebomb173 I said I was being "semi-serious" and identified my point as "literally academic."
And I find it as hilarious as I did when I was 15 that King Arthur's sword is Excalibur, but that his spear is Ron. Just Ron. 😂
@Firebomb173 Maybe you've just had way more experience with people raising their finger and well-actuallying about fascism than I have.
😂😂😂😂 funniest shit I've seen in a while http://t.co/LxJf8dm16Y
@JulysFire I don't underestimate good ol' Ron, no worries. 😂
@Firebomb173 Nah, I just said, half-jokingly that historians may not call hypothetical future fascism "fascism."
I'm going to name two of my future cats Excalibur and Ron...but no one's going to get the reference or the joke. #lifeofanerd
@Firebomb173 100% seriously, whether persons identify as fascists would not necessarily be on my list for determining "are they fascists."
Remember me 😭😭😭😭😭
@Firebomb173 Like, the US right-wing cares less about their own (white) poor than did the fascists about their own (white) poor.
@Firebomb173 Nah, I'm just thinking of specifics (or being pedantic, whichever).

These awards are so stupid but at least we get good pictures of Luke and some good performances.
Soon as i stopped worrying, worrying how my story ends, i let go and i let God.. let God have his way ❤

I can't believe he is almost 50... He's still so so attractive 😍
Hahaha their height difference 😂
If you accelerate on 3, or 2, you will most likely get disqualified. But if you don't accelerate after 1, you will most certainly not win
@DrewAve_3 damn good race!! Bristol is always a fun one.
@EdCates Great.  Thanks, Ed.  I'll be sure and make this my wallpaper.  And have nightmares.  Thanks again!  [pained smile]
I apologize for my tweets this far, and I seriously apologize for my tweets during Dan and Shay's performance.

@PokemonyeWest YOU SON OF A BITCH. you stole my leverage. (Have we ever considered @sluttynature is into polygamy?) could solve a lot
@PokemonyeWest @sluttynature hit me, what's your height?
Tonight has been my livest night on Twitter. Idk if that's good or bad but it didn't involve drake (much) so im growing I guess

@MADAO63 毕竟不是为手表设计的，现在基本也是属于复杂腕表里面的一个功能卖，实际上也没啥人注意靠它变的走时准确，毕竟机械表。沛纳海有3D陀飞轮，两轴旋转可以抵消各个方向，据说屌炸，不过丫给装一个怀表上…

@MADAO63 低端的主要是设计，买个时髦值。中端看机芯和品牌认知度。高端看功能数，功能数和价格的关系是 （品牌认知度^-1）^功能数=价格@MADAO63 没
@MADAO63 就和买车差不多，30万以下的看功能啊，看保养难度啊，看实用性啊。200万以下的看酷炫度啊，开在街上拉风啊，别人认识不认识啊…200万以上的就图自己开个乐子，这时候0-60快个0.1就是几百万的差价了，而且是越奇怪的造型越没听说过的车厂越好…

Also hope they keep the cost low. We pay a fraction of what a normal hangar costs.
I wonder if they’ll upgrade my hangar at Purdue. Right now it leaks water directly onto the windscreen which ALSO leaks onto the avionics.
@FunnelFiasco haha probably. Windshield is being replaced, but the hangars are dumpy. Like old pole-building dumpy.
@IndicaMoon hahaha I was so confused. #tummyrub@IndicaMoon been awhile since a dog gave me a tummy rub, but I’ll accept it.
@k_schellin20 omg I dont think so lol
