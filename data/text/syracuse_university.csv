That is a crap call we need a better call on that BS
I fear for the APOPhi group page and for my Brothers when I'm caffeinated and have access to WIFi
How does that even happen ....... Clear as day
Duke has 5 points in the last 2 minutes off of missed out of bounds calls. Winslow stepped out before Okafor bucket, then reviewed play

Don't be sad that March Madness is over, be glad that it happened. Masters this weekend followed by the start of NHL Playoffs next week.
Feel it for them both. So hard for great, great Wisconsin team for it to end like this. But Duke truly earned it
NCAA should borrow the NBA's centralized replay center for all tournament games
@AbrionaJ lmaoo let me reminisce

i think most jobs just require a college degree because they want to know that you can deal with stupid amounts of stress
college literally is so pointless. like 2% of what you learn will actually be useful. everything else is stressful garbage.

I wonder who makes @BarackObama's hair grayer, Putin or Republicans? I sometimes wonder if they all get together and hang out on weekends.
I could really imagine John Boehner and Putin getting drunk and cracking up over the situations they've put @BarackObama in.

And yet, you work at Wegmans@L28witko Luke, the Crunch are getting pushed off the puck like crazy.  Tanner is playing way too mellow.  He need you to send a pep talk!

I despise using the scale to gauge my weight loss so I bought some jeans from the thrift store a while back &amp; I use them to gauge my weight
They're smaller than the jeans I had a year ago and that's progress for me
There was no size tag so I haven't a clue what size they are which makes me happy I tried  them on just now and they fit pretty damn well 😁

Weight loss is an ongoing process; to me it's a long-term effort that requires conscious lifestyle habit changes like portions &amp; cardio
So I walk everywhere,  and I mean everywhere. To school to work, to the CVS, the Post Office etc.
And Tiger did just fine. Start of the week a T-17 was high hopes in a lot of circles. Overall, should be proud of it@BoltBlaster18 haI had no clue every time we played it was actually for something... Their fans clearly did. I don't get why everyone cares

Guarantee Spieth's girlfriend is gone within the week
No matter if it was expected for days. This is still pretty special. Spieth has no ceiling if he can keep playing like this
Unbelieve sports moment #JordanSpieth #Masters
Is Spieth gonna be angry about missing that par putt to break the scoring record on 18?

I literally JUST figured out that @blink182 made a masturbation reference with "Take Off Your Pants and Jacket" 😑
What's impressive too is that Spieth beat so many of the game's biggest stars when they were playing fairly well. That's REALLY impressive
my lazy level reached an all time low today #sundaze
Also, I did say a 35 would do fine on the back nine. Spieth shot 35. Why can't anyone admit that predictions are mostly dumb luck?

@PostStandard The BLVD will not draw business, it will deter it to East Syr &amp; Dewitt on 481.  It will hinder commerce, &amp; slow traffic. .....@ZaFuul http://t.co/Js3NO7TynH
@PostStandard ...in the modern era, an extra 10-15 minutes of traffic is like an hour in the 50's.  The Blvd will create massive issues.
40 something degrees, so everyone's breaking out shorts. If this was Cali or something, there would be a statewide emergency. Oh New York.
I regret pushing the 'next episode' button of Netflix last night #sleepdeprived

So bae came over last night and simply held my ass.  Perfect way to end my weekend! 😂 I'm so easy to please!
I would vote for Republicans like John Katko, a positive, good guy!  Hate radio &amp; FOX have turned politics into twisted, negative, hate.
I want to see a civilized campaign with intellectual depth.  I want to see MUTUAL RESPECT instead of nasty one liners.
Nothing feels better than the sun beating down on bare skin. Happy spring day in Cuseland 🍊☀️🌷
@mikemcandrew1 Keep in mind, this comes from the same people at City Hall who want to build the BLVD, full of more "fancy" lights!

Guys, the Philip Rivers trade train is real. Would not be shocked (at this point) to see the Chargers deal him and draft Marcus Mariota.
impresora sounds so much cooler than printer
@JohnCassillo That has to be spin from the staff, though that part had been constant. Stipend is new.
That said, would be a huge boon to Chargers if they move to LA soon. Imagine Mariota as the poster child in the city of Angels.

But if you can deal Rivers for the No. 2 pick while shedding salary to address other major needs, then I'd be okay with it.
However, I wouldn't like the move:  1) not a big believer in MM. 2) Chargers are close to being contenders w/Rivers. Move on = not smart.
The weekend of May 9th is looking more exciting each day #fiveyears #timeforreallife #stoked
Just wouldn't like the idea of moving on from a guy like Philip Rivers, who's the heart and soul of that team.

@ryannemcek I think the kid probably just liked Indiana better. Clearly felt more " love" from players. But had to come up with reasons.

@MsWeezy8 essentially admissions department does because it's based on amount reported to federal government.
@MsWeezy8 it's based on the difference between "cost of attendance" reported to govenment and the value of old "athletic scholarship."
@ryannemcek I think that's probably about right. Mom still liked SU based on our talk. But it gave him reasons she had to accept.
At the end of the day id still do anything for her

@DraftChiado @steelers absolutely not. If they draft Gregory I'll lose my mind.
@DraftChiado @jledgePFS @LukeShabroNFL so raw and soft for me. Greater need at CB or S in R1. He won't fall to No. 22 though.

#stopthecargoshortepidemic@DraftChiado @jledgePFS @LukeShabroNFL very good athlete and I understand your love for him, but I think he'd fizzle out in PGH.
@DraftChiado @jledgePFS @LukeShabroNFL watch the tape my man. Gets bodied a lot and gets manhandled against the run. Lewan destroyed him.
@AlbericiEmersyn next time just @ @flack_drew
@jledgePFS @DraftChiado @LukeShabroNFL if they go edge at No. 22 I'll take Ray, but that's it. Has to be a DB or it's a mistake, IMO.
White got @CAZLAX in front, Rogers answers with 3rd goal to pull @WCSDAthletics even again, 4-4, late in 3rd quarter
@DraftChiado @jledgePFS @LukeShabroNFL yeah, but Lewan handled him against the pass, too. I just don't think he'll stay healthy either.
@LukeShabroNFL @jledgePFS @DraftChiado who played more than 200 snaps. They need a Day 1 starter at No. 22. Ugh
@LukeShabroNFL @jledgePFS @DraftChiado damn you, Luke. I don't want it to happen. The guy won't start on a defense that just lost 5 plyrs
@AlbericiEmersyn @flack_drew sure, you tell yourself that
@jledgePFS @LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado 100% agree.
@DraftChiado @LukeShabroNFL @jledgePFS unless it's a guarantee they get Ifo or Steven Nelson at some point in the draft (which it isn't.)
Love chance lol  https://t.co/zpwSM8Itsb
@DraftChiado @LukeShabroNFL @jledgePFS I'll lose my mind. They can't neglect CB or S if Johnson or Landon Collins is on the board.

@LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado @jledgePFS and yes I know he wasn't drafted haha
@LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado @jledgePFS idk...they gave Blake a legit shot.
@AprilMaroshick Ssuurreee!! That's why you posted "Good Morning" 5 hours later today lol😴😮
@KristieMorris5 I'm still "employed" at bath &amp; body but haven't been given a shift in like a month and then a month again before that shift
@LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado @jledgePFS I don't think they would ask LC to do that. Have to force MM into a CF-type FS if they do that. Yikes
@LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado @jledgePFS right, but still gave him a shot at legit playing time. Held his own for the most part. Haha
@LukeShabroNFL @DraftChiado @jledgePFS that's completely fair.

@kenzie_hayes22 pick up the phone 📱
God never makes you let go of anything without the intent on replacing it with something better, so be patient! It's coming.
God has not given us the sport of fear. Anything that your fear isn't of God so pray that thing OUT of your life.

Nudity is a beautiful thing when it's done right. You can always tell if it's in poor taste or for artistic reasons.
I'd love to be naked all the time but clearly I can't do that.
You can see the desperation in ppl who just post nudes all day. It's all in their face.

Good morning all.😊When someone is on a destructive path sometimes the best thing you can do for them is love them from a far and pray.
I can love you and still not condone your choices. I won't stay around, not bc I don't love you, but bc I love me more.
I love my friends but I can see when someone is heading for a cliff. No offense, I just don't need to stress/drama in my life.
Completely blind to the fact she's being used. Throw a few bucks and a couple I love you's and she's all yours.
Most painful thing to watch is someone you love being brought down by someone that doesn't gave genuinely good intentions for them.
I love when I smell like coconuts 😍😩
Praying for better days for you, baby girl. I just miss your shine.😔☀️🌟

When you're willing to love more than you love yourself, you'll always be at the mercy of someone else's feelings towards you...
I hate clowns like that! Straight posers, doesn't care for anyone but themselves and a dollar.

and for the dumb motherfuckers a tripartite soul is a soul that's made up of 3 components
think of it as a chariot with 2 horses; the chariot represents rationality, while the horses represent emotion and passion.

#BruceJennerABCIt takes a great amount of courage to do this.  I hope your family understands and appreciates it.  Still an American hero!
Lets goooooo
@LoriMacc its slightly weirder tonight, but hes always had a weird way of speaking. at least from what i remember.

@LoriMacc it is confusing. ive got a couple college gender classes under my belt so its a little bit easier for me to wrap my mind around.
@lynettejolene I would die on the spot to saw them in person.

ok brody jenner can get it.
@LoriMacc very understandable...but her children could probably use the support.
Can't believe he just stopped Sid
@HuffPostEnt @KrisJenner no comment cuz her public persona more important than Bruces difficult journey, sad its money first, in my opinion
i still think its hysterical that brody jenner was a reality star long before all of his step sisters. #thehills
