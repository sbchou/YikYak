Wisconsin needs to sub me in real quick, I can put this game in the bag
Horrible call lmao
Lol still confused on why they stop for replay at all if they couldn't make that call
literally guessed on my brackets for class and chose duke to win to find out that they actually made it to the final 😂😂
@KiNGCEASER_32 hell yeah f that noise. He's cheating
All I know is I've never been to a prom &amp; I'm gonna make this one worth it. Nobody's stopping me from making it a night to remember 👫💑

@phillybikes @Philambulator @bobbybeans215 I support enforcement. My point is that streets that are well-designed do much of their own enf.
@phillybikes @Philambulator @bobbybeans215 I think Spruce/Pine best as protected bike lanes, but other places filtered permeability good.

@LDureault96 smh bye
@NancyCawleyJean I'm doing pretty good , a PT less day. Awaiting swelling to go down in shoulder/upper arm to fit in my shirts....you?
"@Marsbxtch: Damn Aaron Hernandez snitchin?!" I'm not surprised
So when you feel alone in the night time .. Just know that you ain't ever on your own cause every body goes through the lows
Most teams don't shoot well &amp; many don't run patterned offenses. So how's taking 5 seconds off the shot clock going to make the game better?
"@Marsbxtch: @datruckdriver87 if he did, he should be ashamed of himself Smfh" that's what most "gangsta" doI have never hit my daughter tho can't do it
I remember I hit my son kinda hard and i felt like shit. I try to talk to him if I don't work then I make em do physical duties usually work
Every day is #NationalBeerDay at the barn but we'll celebrate a little more today
@_thenamesalicia @Marsbxtch not even my pelas were vicious and I hated my parents for that. I make my kids do physical work

Going to go stay in CT for the night
@_thenamesalicia @Marsbxtch are well behaved kids only son is a little brat at school at times but with me he be on point lol
All the terrible verbiage and wordplay aside, I think Hernandez defense did a great job with their closing arguments.
@_thenamesalicia @Marsbxtch yeah in public I'll pulled their ears or a little cocotazo lmfao but that's as severe as I go but my kids
Gonna be hard to convict on 1st degree murder. 2nd degree or manslaughter would have been smarter of the prosecution, IMO
@RackedUpLem nothing I just raise my voice at her and that usually breaks her down don't want her to think a man hitting her is ok fuck that
"@2015exposetime: Only person that's scared of Aaron is his bitch lol" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀

Ok friends, need some help. Actual science that supports eating organic vs not? Is there any out there?
part of my interview for this internship is naming all the shows I watch and I'm realizing it would be easier to list shows I don't watch
Like you dropped the gum right in front of the trash you couldn't try to put it in again???
