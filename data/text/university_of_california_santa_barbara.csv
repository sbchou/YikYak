I'm so over being sick. Colds are the worst too because usually you need to just let them run their course...Lol I know it's only one game, but I feel like the Cubs - despite their vastly improved roster - will find a way to blow it this season.
I mean, Lester throws the ball decently with on 3 ER and the Cubs get blanked at HOME on OPENING NIGHT?! Not good...
I like figuring how who's peoples indirects are about
I also think leaving Bryant in the minors was a mistake too but that's besides the point.

@mikeybolts  going of to college this fall 😬any advice?
Ducks look like their coasting out there
Ducks need to get more SOG's and look for rebounds instead of dumping and chasing!
Really would like to see more speed out of the Ducks, the dump and grind is not working

Shoutout to @PrateekMalani  RT @chrisdvalentin: But sometimes you gotta be like @Nike and #JustDoIt
But sometimes you gotta be like @Nike and #JustDoItBias as fuck but fuck it lol
The 2012 49ers are literally the best team I've ever seen play
@E_Chill1 lol no I just know how to stand up for myself 😇
If Nike is the Greek goddess of Victory.
I should start a brand named “Victoria” for the Roman goddess of Victory. We will be rivals
Nothing in the world ever hurt more than watching the 49ers lose Super Bowl 47
@Vega6577 should have been champions &lt;3
It's so heartbreaking watching The Quarterback cause you know they don't even have to fake that sadness. That's real grief.
@Golden_Dick56 especially on bullshit plays&lt;\3
5 fucking yards away.
@chrisdvalentin @Nizzleray Lets do this
Blessed to have seen such a dominant defense in SF throughout the Harbaugh era

HEY EVERYONE, IVE ACCIDENTALLY BEEN TAKING 3 ANTIBIOTICS EVERY 8 HOURS RATHER THAN 1 AND NOW I'M GONNA DIE, THX FOR RETWEETING ME, K BAI
@jayedguz They'll take one. No way Spurs take both with Tony Parker averaging like 4 points in 2 games. Duncan just played out of his mind.
@MickThunderBang you scared the shit out of me HAHAH &lt;3
@Geeduup Blake Griffin is a fuckin bitch. Chris Paul is locked in right now tho my nigga. They'll take at least 1 in San Antonio, trust.
Can't stand Duncan's bitch ass. Blake Griffin is a straight female in the clutch. Clippers in 6.
@MickThunderBang ily mickey, this is my final goodbye 💀💀
On another note, i went off in my intramural basketball game hahaha
Längtar till imorgon. Lillördag
@pozosaloon @sammyshapiroxo r u even famous
@honeynutnadi I want to hang it on my wall lol it's so dope
@jayedguz pussy ass hacking. Clippers are the better team by far. The winner of game 3 takes the series forsure tho.
@jambii21 coming to california in August!
@jayedguz You really expect Mills to go for 18 again? Haha i don't even like the Clippers, but the only advantage the Spurs have is the
If you don't lift we can't date 
Why tf would I want someone small foh@jayedguz They're probably the most well rounded team in the NBA except for the weak ass bench. CP3 should've had that ball, fuckin bullshit

HAHAH STEPH SENT MY MOM A VIDEO AND SHE REPLIED "LMAO"
@jayedguz No way they lose the game. I just wanna see Clippers and Rockets, Warriors and Grizzlies, Cavs and Bulls, then i'll be a happy man
Bueno a dormir que descansen y felices sueños.
@jayedguz It fuckin sucks that they have to use Barnes over Crawford for defense down the stretch on Kawhi. If Griffin goes for 30 in game 3
@LiamCox35 😏
Of course @bondaxuk would go on a North American tour and not come to California...still bummed about that hard summer cancellation in 2013.

@juxeyedea dude I was just talking about that. I need old boys noize! I'm stoked for ten walls, t williams, caribou and jamie xx also though
Why do I even bother coming to the lib if I do the same things here that I do at home aka online shopping and looking at my phone aimlessly
@jayedguz I agree. Fuck the Bulls tho so let's just say Cavs will ahaha. Straight up, i think Grizzlies will do it. That D is raw, no homo
@MickThunderBang DEF OR ILL CRY
i want to be both my mom and dad combined when i grow up.....wait...@NostalgicBre @juxeyedea damn, how did you miss caribou?! Who did you see? But yeah, at least you have another chance!
@nolanxryan7 I was gonna put that but I ran out of room to write it 🙈

are humans just expected to be in a constant battle with themselves? always unhappy with what we have and trying to change somehow?

@sfreedson228 @DanielLawall3 but when we face any team they have the same advantage
@DanielLawall3 @sfreedson228 facts Daniel, anyone who plays their benefits as well when playing the Yankees
Last night at a party this guy put me on his shoulders and I thought it was @reggie_cason but it definitely wasn't him :/ lolol
Just saw a car with a bumper sticker that read "Masterbation is not a crime." I was too busy reading it to take a photo 😒 Good laugh though.
@sfreedson228 @DanielLawall3 we may hit more home runs but our home run differential won't change@sfreedson228 @DanielLawall3 ovr the year we migh hit more but it doesn effect how many wins we get cuz when other teams play they get it to
The only people who can say "k" to me without me getting irritated is my mom and dad
@sfreedson228 every single game at home gives both teams an advantage so for that game it is even. And if that happens every game it is even
