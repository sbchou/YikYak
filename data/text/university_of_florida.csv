@AllWaltrip @KentuckyMBB only championships matter in sports. In the end, 2+ losses &amp; a championship is better than 1 loss &amp; no championship

@YavolFoxxen That doesn't stop the fact that I'm the person he asked out :/@YavolFoxxen Enough of this fox. I do no wish to dwell on it further.
All good things must come to an end. That is an equation.
But that is for another time. Wolf is going to go rest now. He has dwelt too much on things that need not trouble him so.
A good lie to make me feel better I suppose would work.
Let me enter the dreamscape once more. And forget what I have learned. Maybe the dream god will grant me clemency for one night.
I've been tossed around enough as is. I think I can survive this.
I'm going to leave him a chance to explain himself. He's earned that much at least. Maybe I just need to hear it from him that we're over.“@FunnyPicsDepot: Swipe up to see Superman fly http://t.co/ycZVmOQfh7”@cassidydalberg#HalaMadridYNadaMasGreat cross by James!

For a few months, a group of seniors and parents have been putting together an event where seniors and their parents can all come together.
We only have 400 tickets, they're free, and you can bring two guests, but please RSVP soon, as tickets will go fast.
@rivchristian I'd probz feel more lucky I know you if you brought me cookies just saying...(but don't bring them during Passover or I'll 😭)
There will be a slideshow, a student speaker, a guest speaker, and a reception afterwards. Get your tix here http://t.co/pSvUtrQSzKin You, death has lost its sting
mr7 (to the tune of 'good king wenceslaus'): but i don't have easter songs, so i'm singing christmas songs

Idk why people think Cal can't coach....idc how good the recruiting class, 5 star 18-19 year olds doesn't guarantee a titleIf Cal had been coaching at UK the same amount of time as Coach K at Duke im pretty sure he'd have more than one title

@Ls_Up_850 it's not guaranteed Billy would have won, we choked 4 straight years with teams more than capable of winning a natty the last 4
@Ls_Up_850 years, Duke always has stud classes and other than this year Coach K's teams been choking, only so much a coach can do
Staying true to my team!!! #OkraStrong #DeltaState #FutureAlum http://t.co/lN0Jwp8YLL
@sofla40742 black/white kids for the win ✊
@_AngryNeeson52 that doesn't guarantee a win tho, just because players kill in HS doesn't mean they kill in college, we always see this
@Ls_Up_850 never said top 5 but it's dumb to say he can't coach, his Memphis team wasn't full of 5 stars and they still almost won the natty

I could easily say give Billy D coach K's roster and he could have won a title too... People never wanna acknowledge that

Refs in this game are going to have rough mornings trying to pass whistles they have swallowed. Both ways, but really physical.

@Shad_Agee lol that's who I think we draft unless we get lucky as hell and get pick 1 or 2, LA really likes Towns so I think they take him
@ryanthomas04 @CarsonKam you would have a lot of Mountain Dew and Cheeto laiden money.
@Shad_Agee yup, people from the Lakers camp were saying they like Towns over Okafor as of now
Leslie Frazier was at the Gators pro day with three other scouts.

About time this savage practice was condemned. If a woman is too dumb to get a D&amp;C at the beginning, she should be sterilized.@StevenErtelt
@Shad_Agee he's Better defensively than Okafor and a 80% FT shooter and about the same in the post, his stats just aren't as good b/c UK has
Finding out @TylerZulewski wants to come here for grad school was some pretty great news 🐊🐊👬👯
Getting excited for #Gainesville Craft Beer Week!  Special FM releases every day next week leading up to the @HogtownBeerFest.  Cheers!

@defnotbsg which game?
Expecting too much is one way of hurting yourself.
The sweetest things you can do for a girl are the little things that let her know she's in your heart and on your mind.
Find a guy that doesn't stop going out of his way to make you happy just because he got what he wanted.
Sometimes you gotta accept the fact that certain things will never go back to how they used to be.
u know a girl is mad when she starts off her sentence saying "I find it funny how " bc there's a 99.9% chance she did not find it funny

No one knows why today's pitchers have a higher susceptibility to injury than they did back a few decades ago
In 2 years Elfrid Payton and Victor Oladipo will be the best guard combo in the NBA.
Is one of those issues - pants? “@nytimes: A look at where Rand Paul stands on 5 major issues http://t.co/9SbeCkToOx” http://t.co/U05vjyiumg

Troy Polamalu's career reminds me a lot of Ed Reed's. Both were great in their prime, but also plagued with injuries later on.
One more thing they'll have in common come 5 years from now: both Polamalu and Reed will be NFL Hall of Famers. #TroyPolamalu #HallOfFame

Panel went well!!!!! Almost died because a Doctor went before me and also presented on Kamala Khan and hers was SO GOOD.
I can't think of a better thing to do after spending four hours doing my taxes than crying into a triple cheeseburger from McDonald's.
But she told me mine was good, and some other people said it was good, and the Q&amp;A was SO ENERGETIC, it was invigorating!
Got the Doctor's info and she got mine and will continue to develop my research into Ms. Marvel/Kamala Khan :) Feeling awesome.

So Cavs didn't play LeBron, Love in 4th qtr, allowing Celtics to win. Wonder how fans in Indy and Miami feel about that?
연합뉴스 기사에서는 "미국 10대 빈곤층 '페이스북', 부유층 '트위터' 애용" 라는 제목과 함께 "미국 10대 청소년들의 '휴대전화 중독' 증세가 심각한 가운데"라며 기사를 시작했다. 어찌된 일인지 퓨리서치에는 "빈곤층"이나 "중독"이란 말이 없다.Idk maybe I'm #beta as fuck but I think MMA is disgusting
퓨리서치가 가구당 소득에 따라 10대 청소년들이 어떤 SNS을 사용하는지 조사한건 맞다. 하지만 표현은 아주 달랐다. 퓨는 가구당 소득이 낮을수록 페이스북 사용자가 더 많았고 높을수록 페이스북 치중도가 낮아진다고 했지, 트위터 애용이란 말도 없었다.
My brother just caught a spider crawling in his ear.. talking bout "tf, I can't live with y'all" 😭
Thugger.. Carter VI though?.. 😐😐😐😐
The Taco Bell commercial where the old woman flashed her powder sacks to her husband Jesus Christ
트위터 사용도에 대한 표현은 "Twitter shows a similar pattern by income, with the wealthiest teens using Twitter more than their least well-to-do peers."
즉, 퓨는 부유층이란 표현은 사용하되 극빈층이란 말은 사용하지 않았다. 트위터 애용이 아니라 최소 소득층에 비할때 더 늘어난다.. 정도. 그리고 사실 트위터 자체 사용률이 다른 SNS에 비해 현저히 낮다.

I want a big spoon😕@flzlslwbtm 트위터를 사용하다니! 부르주아지!!
연합뉴스 김종우 특파원은 극단적인 표현이 함의된 단어를 일방적으로 선택하여 퓨의 리서치 결과를 미국 10대들도 별다를거 없음. 페북은 난장판. 애들한테 폰주면 안 됨. 트위터는 부르주아들의 놀이터. 요딴 상상의 나래를 펼치게 하려던게 아닐까 싶을 정도

읽는 김에 조금 더 퓨의 결과를 읽어보았다. 기사가 페북과 트이타로 집중조명했지만 미국10대가 제일 자주 가는건 페북, 그 뒤는 인스타, 그 뒤는 스냅챗, 그 뒤에야 트이타. 순서는 소득에 관계없이 동일. 하지만 랭킹을 두었을때의 비중은 조금씩 변함.
@BlockA_126 haha she's moving to Gainesville soon, I'm sure she would love for you to come help her move her shit again😂😂@BlockA_126 I knew you would get excited
난 또 어떻게 조사한건가 했더니 랭킹이었어 ㅋㅋㅋ 트이타는 사실 별로 주목 못받고 있고 미국10대 대상으로 할거면 페북이나 스냅챗에 집중했어야지 ㅋㅋ 인스타야 워낙 요즘 핫하고. 인스타는 소득과 상관없이 핫핫.

Cons about working out late at night: your mind is now wide awake from the adrenaline and you probably won't sleep tonight. #Insomnia@NBCBlacklist why is there a 3 week break? If they aren't ready to go weekly just push the season premiere back. We'd hate that less.

Even tho there's no tackling on special teams plays here, Demarcus Robinson goes untouched and scores a touchdown returning opening kickoff
Orange leads Blue 6-0.

Demarcus Robinson returns the opening kickoff for a touchdown.
Should be noted that there was no live tackling allowed on the kickoff.
@SannizL you don't deliver?

At my favorite taco spot.
Kelvin Taylor with a short TD run. Orange leads Blue 13-0. Will Grier looked sharp on the drive. Had two third down completions.Orange team rolls down the field for a score. Lot of walk-ons were on defense. Goolsby with a big series at tight end.
Officially a two-yard TD run for Taylor.
I shook CeCe Jeffersom's hand and just like his entire hand over wrapped mine, so glad this guy is a Florida Gator!

Treon Harris now out on the field for team Blue. And gets sacked.
Score is 7-0. I counted the kickoff TD by accident. Carry on.
Harris throws incomplete deep on third and 13.
The backup offensive line struggled, to say the least, against Florida's first team defense there.

We hear about white privilege. Now let's talk about black privilege: get paid for not working, allowed to burn buildings when thugs caught.
Harris drives down the field but stalls out at the nine. Austin Hardin makes a 26-yard FG to put Orange up 10-0.

Florida's o-line hasn't had a chance in this game. Regardless of color.
More black privilege: endless unemployment compensation, endless disability compensation, endless food stamps, paid for not working.
20 seconds were added to the second quarter and the Blue team gets on the board with a 34-yd FG from Powell. At the half, Orange 10, Blue 3.

Another short run into the end zone by Kelvin Taylor good for a TD. Hardin completes the PAT. Orange 17, Blue 3@BBurnsNHL is that garrison on the left?

Judging by the cheers from the crowd, I think everyone enjoyed that 42-yd pass from Harris to Robinson.
Pretty 2 throws by treon
Treon Harris to C'yontai Lewis, good for a 5-yd TD. Orange increases their lead over Blue, 24-3. #OBdebut
That also brings us to the end of the third.
Nice drive by Treon Harris. Throws a 5-yard TD to C'yontai Lewis. Also had a 42-yard throw to Demarcus Robinson on the drive. Orange 24-3.

Some people who you think always got your back have their own motives
"I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around. I'd rather take a fall myself, than have you bring me down." ✌🏼
For the first time ever a guy at the bar offered to by me a drink because I was beautiful. Today was a great day #accomplished ✔️

@tejasjulia @SmartBitches I promise you, YOU WILL HAVE NIGHTMARES FOR YEARS!!!
@tejasjulia @SmartBitches I can buy cupcakes to send to the bake sale, but the black market for science projects is a bitch to navigate.
@tejasjulia @SmartBitches Worst is when kids look at you with the "You are massive fail at this parenting thing" expression.
@SmartBitches @tejasjulia My son made it to the county finals one year, and often adds, "No  thanks to _you_" when he reminds me.
@SohnsTed Reminds me of Monty Python's The Meaning of Life "every sperm is sacred..."

Some people will provide every excuse for cops shooting someone, what does "living the life a cop does" have anything 2 do with this case?
Some white folks saying he shouldn't have ran, ok true but he wasn't shot when he was running... Situation was handled and then he was shot
I'm all for cops protecting themselves in any situation but the shit is getting ridiculous, 8 times to the back and one guy on the ground...
@ozzyog nah that's like asking to get robbed 🙋🔫

I feel like Tyler took a huge step forward as a producer on #CherryBomb but took a couple steps back as a rapper imho...
but the thing is, he doesnt care to be a "rapper" he just makes whatever he wants... but still. he's a rapper.
Even on Wolf he had bars but Cherry Bomb is more of a creative progression in his career.
he does still have good raps but I think they took a back seat to the producing and artistry he was aiming for.annnd I was reallyyy hoping for a continuation of his last albums...or was wolf the end? frm bastard "3 sessions, today, tomorrow&amp; the next"

It was the power of the Harry potter glasses @h_cacciatore @GreysenCacciato
@alexis_plettl @celine_elise TAY
UF has more Natty's in BBall the last 15 years than UK does, 9 titles will trump 2 any day no matter how recent the titles are
Change of plans 😆
It kinda does suck the Heat aren't making the playoffs... But hey 10th pick here we come! WATCH OUT NEXT YEAR NBA!!! @MiamiHEAT WILL BE BACK

Right or wrong
I could definitely see charging Hernandez with 2nd degree murder but idk how they proved the premeditated aspect to get 1st degree charged
We have to stop this race thing

Straight out tha f..kin dungeons of rap !
@fsunelson lol ok
State had a pretty weak story for asking for 1sr degree, Lloyd did something 6 months prior and Hernandez wanted payback? Hard to proveWow!  What a sad story for #AaronHernandez .  I hope he finds Jesus then he can be free even while in prison; He can still be victorious! 🙌
It's great watching the guy in front of me make out with a girl on our way to Disney. Yay for us
State had the video and a shaky testimony to try and convict Hernandez, people get off easy b/c of that lack of evidence #ShakyJusticeSystem
Can I redeem all of my un-used naps from pre school now?

If you need me, I'll be casually looking down at my chest &amp; readjusting my shirt for the rest of the day.
@SecondToNONE8 lol I mean yea he will and I think he should win because that was a weak case but as of now he has no parole
I hate losing bets @KaliMcAuley
@AEric71 and they got it wrong than they had against Hernandez
@AEric71 lol I was too young back then but I know everyone still calls bullshit, I'm pretty sure the state had a better case against him
Law should say. Men and hit women. But we can knock a hoe out!!! 😴😴
illmatic is one of the few albums I felt lived up to the hype. Might be a top-10 for me. Not sure but its up there.
@uSTADIUM Tough to tell, Winston right now because he's used to the pro-style offense but Mariota could flourish as well
This is why I can't be a criminal attorney or prosecutor, shaky cases= Guilty and obvious cases= innocent , I'll stick to corporate law
最近周り恋ツイート多いんだけど、やっぱり春だからですか？（笑）
@uSTADIUM Sorry ass Bucs who will get Winston so I hope he works out, and we've gotten rid of almost everybody we signed last year basically

@MarcCarig Campbell at 3B and either Kirk or Mayberry in LF.
@jeinamic it on themselves tho, I won't defend us

30 for 30: The Aaron Hernandez Story.
From Catching Touchdowns to Catching Bodies
Hernandez showed no emotion just like a killer would throughout the whole case, have to show sympathy to gain sympathy from the jury
@NaomiTheWeirdo Possibility of that and she used being a "grieving mother" as an excuse, ppl always fall for that bullshit
Btw folks saying that the SC cop that was charged shows Justice, he pretty much had to be charged with that video, w/o it he isn't charged

@SupaTroopaDunny yeah, so it wouldn't have been that big of a surprise if he got off on this case.@SupaTroopaDunny by no means should he be free. But I thought he would beat this one and lose the double homicide.
@SupaTroopaDunny I think everyone knows he did it. But everyone also knows that Casey Anthony committed murder.
@AlexisKunk we miss you more! You are so beautiful💝
@SupaTroopaDunny I'm absolutely not defending him. I am just saying I wouldn't have been shocked if he won this case. And lost the next one.

@Lisa_Monroe20 That's why extra schooling is the way to go, bachelors almost trash nowadays
Ask yourself, "what would a reasonable person do?" There are not enough reasonable people out there. ESPECIALLY not on college campuses.

#NXTGainesville @WWEDillinger's perfect 10 gimmick is a perfect 10. Old school, straight forward heel work. Loved booing him.
@DanaBrookeWWE's boots tonight at #NXTGainesville were great! Like the whole attire of course! Great to finally see us in action LIVE!

I have been working so many days straight with little/sleep I lost teach of the days. I thought was sat. Score an extra day!!
오늘 아침 늦잠자면서 남친님이 나한테 헤어지자고 하고 나는 우는걸 멈추지 못하고 막 그러다 깨어났는데.. 그래서 그런지 하루종일 괜히 울적하다. 왠 개꿈은 꿔가지고!
@jiyooong 아아.. 뭘 준비해야될지도 모르겠어요.
깨자마자 남친님한테 전화걸어서 이상한 꿈꿨다고 얘기했더니 어이없어함.. 남친님은 니가 스트레스 요즘 많이 받았나보네- 하고 말았는데 그래도 우울해.
How am I to be an optimist about this?
Maybe it's just the bald look, but every time I see Wilson Fisk I think of Hank Schrader. #Daredevil #BreakingBad

Let me rephrase that thought into English. I want real people following me, not bots.
@joemoore10 @_Coach_Dre I don't think Tebow is a starting NFL QB. I just think he can at least be on a roster. Blaine Gabbert is on a roster

@MagicJohnson this was yesterday
Midgets man
@joemoore10 @_Coach_Dre I guess me &amp; Dre are arguing diff things. I don't think TT will be successful. Just think he should make a roster
@GerlicaJ10 THATS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A SERIES FINALE. I thought the hurricane scene was a joke at first....
this 700 or 800 lb lady stood up for this first time in over a year in a half lmfao

Of all the NFL teams, Tebow goes to the one I dislike the most.
When the guys at work Don't know you speak Spanish #keeptalkingaboutme 😏
Good things come to those who wait!!! #TEBOWTIME #TebowTimeInPhillyAnd just FYI, waiting doesn't mean sitting around and doing nothing hoping something good falls in your lap.
when I die fuck it I wanna go to hell cuz I'm a piece of shit it ain't hard to fuckin tell

아까 오후에 저녁먹으면서 무도 틀어놨는데 사건이 사건인지라 장동민 나오는 장면에선 나도 모르게 고개를 돌리게 됨. 정말 이젠 꼴보기 싫은 얼굴이 되어버렸구나. 그리고 유재석은 자기 잘못도 아닌데 또 사과를 하고...
원래 비정상회담은 꼭꼭 챙겨보곤 했는데 이제 ㅇㅅㅇ때문에 보지도 않을거 같다. 한번 보기 싫으니까 그냥 아예 보고싶지가 않아졌어.
When I first heard the story I thought it was filmed outside of our country but no it took place here!! How is this even happening
And second WHY THE FUCK were the cops not helping her?! This whole thing makes NO SENSE to me!
I respect her so much and hope she got those students kicked out and those cops fired.
I would never think someone who fought for our country would have to stand up for our flag that represents our nation in our schools...
Update: when I get too stressed over finals, I go to the bathroom and lip sync whatever music I'm feelin.

@jowrotethis @aCastofKings I don't know why Roose Bolton isn't on her list. IMO he's one of the worst because he was Robb's bannerman.
So LSU has 3 15 signees -- Simmons (1), Blakeny (14), Sampson (39) all rated higher than Florida's highest-rated signee, K. Allen (53).
Per http://t.co/cYPQtdzU5O Top 100, Florida's signees are rated as follows -- K. Allen (53), Dickerson (58), K. Hayes (75) and Stone (78).

@kevintsolove Egbunu was a borderline Top 100 prospect in 2013Gm⛅️
@kevintsolove Francis was a top 30 to 40 prospect. But both Francis and Egbunu will be sophs next season.
2004 UF class, per Rivals -- Brewer (31), Horford (36), Noah (75), T. Green (105). Best in Gator history.
So while nice to have an impact player at top of recruiting class, not always necessary. But Allen as best player at 53 low for my taste.
@kevintsolove Billy develops them, if they stay, would like to see more of the 4-year classes and less transfers.

@cgreenorisit played well in Peach Jam and peaked in mid-30s. We will see. Some of recruiting rankings based on hype.
Florida 2007 class -- Calathes (10), J. Lucas (19), Parsons (44), Tyus and Adam Allen not in top 100.@KevGilley speculation of Billy leaving for NBA hurts, perception of football school used against Gators in recruiting.
@KMunie7 nah take a shot everytime they butcher a hockey player's name it's fun
@Ivo_Solis yep, Parsons turned out to be the best of the bunch because he stayed 4 years and developed.
Final tmrw but naps are much more important
I don't even know what I'm doing in a library

@KrispyKRAME_2 we do not have the best fourth line in the NHL. Our 4th line possession numbers suck. Especially Ott's. Hits are meaningless
Life is so boring since I broke my earbuds and can't listen to podcasts in public
@_ChristianBelt we talked about this blood lol
@alexcarlson96 yea wtf was that
@alexcarlson96 yea lmao
@_ChristianBelt never.
You can't run from God. 
Sorry.
@KrispyKRAME_2 if you are hitting all the team it means you don't have the puck. If you don't have puck the other team does and can score
@BabyGiinge ur tweets are very relatable today
@AdamRubinESPN Kevin McReynolds
@KrispyKRAME_2 Andrew Shaw is perfect example. Gritty player. Also had15 goals this year and positive poss stats. Ott? 3 in last 100+ games

@chrishenry136 is the 2.9 if you don't do anything else at all? That's pretty legit.
People good at wiring things on my twitter feed. How hard would it be to set up a set of waterproof speakers to play music while I showered?
@FantasticMrFolf It's left me in situations where I had $700 left over to splurge on sushi on the last night of the con.
@_____stellar I keep getting notified when you tweet. Stop, I'm trying to hang out with my friends.
@FantasticMrFolf I do the 1.5x the cost of budgeted expenses.

@goddamnmitch not really idk I just hate when someone tries to be like the third person in a relationship like no bye
@ESPNDari I’m hoping K Ollie from UConn since they already got KD’s college PG, why not an old NBA teammate for their coach?
@JTMIA_ that's what I'm saying! some girls think that if your best friend doesn't like your boyfriend it's the end of the world lmaoI’m honestly not sure how I feel about the Scott Brooks firing yet. I wanted him gone but yet injuries ruined the last 3 seasons so idk
I wish I can go to the Burberry fashion show 🇬🇧💂🏻
Hope they get Kevin Ollie as their next coach, being a former teammate of Durant may make him more likely to stay beyond next season

@Quizz12_WVU anyone in the west can beat the cavs. Memphis, Clippers, Rockets, Warriors, healthy Thunder, etc.
@Quizz12_WVU Spurs actually have a worse chance than those listed because Parker is banged up and Manu’s age is really showing too
@LD2K good console terms please? (Xb1) lol

I bet it's MuschampI'm di in love with cheese daddy
@MiigoRush shit don’t say nothing

Forever thinking of fire insta captions that no one will understand
@DarlingReina will do!
@Quizz12_WVU Golden State EXECUTES though! Bro I thought they were overrated too until I saw what they did down the stretch vs Pels twice
@Gconnn shiiit... Well I'll be coming home a lot and we can hang out like a couple of tool bags in the 727
@Quizz12_WVU if they’re healthy, maybe. I still give them a helluva lot better chance than Spurs or Clips though. Rockets, Dubs and Grizz
Redbull got me back in the gameThe only thing I ever want to tweet anymore is "#blessed" so that's pretty cool actually

😂😂😂 I take my sports talk serious, believe me
@Quizz12_WVU well I got facts and yeah. Believe me, I’ll be happy for MEM if they win, bc Conley and Koufos are Buckeyes, but I think GS&gt;MEM
Just two hours after 1st @UFAlert sent to @UF students, suspect is in custody. Thank you #UPD &amp; @GainesvillePD for keeping our campus safe!

I can get 4 months worth of spotify premium for 1 month of Tidal. Why would I switch?
Tidal was just *very* poorly planned and thought out business idea. I mean, their CEO got fired not even a month after its launch...
I hate people.

It's complicated.
Even if you do the $10 / mo. Tidal subscription thats not the high-quality one then whats the point of switch from spotify?
Tidal isnt even in the top 750 apps on iTunes 😂😂😂. Not even in the top 40 in the music category.Maybe if Tidal involved smaller artists and didnt charge a ridiculous amount I would consider switching.
