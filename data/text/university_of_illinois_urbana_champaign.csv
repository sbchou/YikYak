Vetter Easter throwback. http://t.co/ObGY6wwLjZMamaFlo always keeping up with the holidays. 🐰🌷 http://t.co/QsHmOBVzzY
DEATH IS NOT THE END!! Thank you for all the blessings in my life!! 💜#HeIsRisen
To continue with my thoughts from yesterday, I think India has a crazy holiday culture mixed with pseudo-secularism. (1/n)
Happy easter to every one. #pasta #handmade #pasqua #easter #uovo #eggs #flour #love @ urbana, il https://t.co/csO8YL8zSC
In the present controversy, I recall that the PM went to the US on a state visit even while observing a fast. (3/n)
Great Easter service with a great friend #HeIsRisen @ St John's Lutheran Church &amp; School https://t.co/erpl00SW3V
I've been to a fair number of countries, nowhere is every single festival accompanied by a shutdown of the country. (2/n)
But suddenly, with a conference on Good Friday (hardly work), secularism is in grave danger. (5/n)
In that instance, nobody said Hinduism was in danger because a govt authority was working in festival time. (4/n)
I've explained what the deep Congress is before: media, bureaucrats, "intellectuals" and many more, allied to the Congress. (7/n)
Let's just say it bluntly: the 'deep Congress' is working to turn Christians into the new minority of India. (6/n)
And most Muslims have anyway understood that the Congress has used them in the most despicable of ways. (9/n)
I want more piercings 😩
@IlliniAces That's EXACTLY what we're saying!
Obviously, Muslims, that old minority, have ditched the Congress for either AAP or their own parties like MIM. (8/n)
Happy Easter! Jesus has risen !!!!So now it's the turn of Christians to hold the mantle of secularism in a mad rush to the bottom of the pyramid. (10/n)
It must be Easter, I have a handful of Reece's foils😂😂😂@WGM_14_ @Alexis_Miller19 @mckenna_emily
wonderful Easter in Illinois with great people // He is RISEN @ Windsor Road Christian Church https://t.co/dneDX00ksI
While the vast majority will be left to fend for itself. They'll do better than Muslims because of better education... (12/n)
Denim jacket. Michael Jackson over the speakers. Brunch. Happy Easter. @ Big Grove Tavern https://t.co/s43DL1TyVL
And it will lead to the same result: some so-called Christian leaders will become all powerful, their kids rich. (11/n)
...but they will land up at the bottom nonetheless. Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. (13/n)
I feel sad that so many educated Christians can fall for this. But then, scientific education &amp; religion don't mix. (15/n) n=15
Tokenism, fake secularism, handouts will not help any community and it is NOT secularism. It is crony socialism. (14/n)
He is alive. #HappyEaster
I want to make another pt. I think it is HIGHLY inappropriate for a constitutional authority like SC Judge or PM to deliver... (1/2)
religious sermons on TV on any day. Private citizens ofc can, but not constitutional authorities. That's not secularism. (2/2)The irony of #AK49 accusing others of abusing him &amp; using sting operations against him to get famous!

Yes.  #TWITTERMONDAY.  Let's do this.

I wish I could say the #DelhiRoadRage incident shocks me. But having been to Delhi, it seems normal, sadly. (1/n)Sure, this was an extreme incident. But it's not unusual to hear gunshots over parking problems! (5/n)
But it's not the politicians - the general people of Delhi are quite lawless from my experience. (4/n)
噗…每天早上出门都忘带东西。今天是没带电脑电源…看来中午有必要回家一趟了。
And this despite Delhi sucking up funds from other states to become a so-called first world city. Yeah, right. (6/n)

@BrenanChacon yeah when they killed off Tommy in the Rugrats I was pretty upset. Surprised me that he died during the opening credits too.
Dumb foul. #stupidcoaching
You can't come back after a big W!
Yo Duke still sucks though
it was at that moment that wisconsin knew, they F'd up.
well that was a frustrating end to an exciting game. Refs got a little too friendly to Duke towards the end. Good game though overall.
Tyus Jones is unreal

Don't worry Wisconsin fans. North Carolina...I mean Duke will win another one in the next four years and completely forget about this one.
K's a great coach. Got this team to play defense down the stretch. Took Badgers out of their game. A worthy champion.
LETS GO DUKE
@laurenmroz you go to Duke?
YES I FREAKING CALLED ITTTTTTT
you foul the best free throw shooting freshman on the team. 88.5% from the line for Tyus Jones.
When you're trying to pee but the girl that gets in hour long screaming fights with her boyfriend locked herself into the bathroom to cry😓
I'm just glad Wisconsin got Kentucky to lose
What was questionable about Bo's coaching? Again, the coach doesn't grab rebounds or score
I suggest everyone go out and see home RIGHT NOW #poomp
Duke wins. Gotta love it when a lovable underdog wins...
"@_Zilla35: I might lose my bracket but I'm 3/3 on championships in 2015." Yea but it's all about picking the champion!

@RobLowe Which Rob Lowe is this? #RobLowesForever@whitesox finally!!Hava a great home opener,Wh Sox--and thanks so much for being smole-free in IL!I hav always been a nonsmoker but hav
@whitesox suffered a lot from toxic secondhandsmoke!Ah'm being poisoned all the time wiith it although I am in total compliance with the2014
@whitesox Illinois nonsmoking laws and live in a place where I snd others have Medicarewhich surely does not siupport patients who smoke!I
@whitesox pay full rent for my apt!Many here do not,ah am told!Yet despite my compliancd with the law,I hav secondhand smoke in my apt much@whitesox io the time!I pay taxes in IL!I have never broken the law,yet I am being poisoned by those who do!Smoking is one of the few drug
@whitesox The high-pitched whine in my apt ccomes from smokers across the hall,who should find places where they can smoke but not in this
@whitesox building with elderly and their vulnerable little pets!If they are repeated violators and can't pay increasing fines under the law
@whitesox they have to be arrested and maybe put on a nonsmoking rehab progam!All this keeps me sleep deprived and is killler theft!
One other major point is that we do live across the street from cornfields and other productive crops atthe U of I which feeds the world!
In a state with agriculture which is excellent andfeeds the world,don't we need to make an extra effort to relocate smokers who smoke insideand out and who pollute our total environment?Both firsthand and secondhand smoke are drugs which poison,literally,the total environment,in
a way that few other drugs do!They need to be controlled substances NOW!
@whitesox I tried to say have a great home opener,Wh sox!Good,smoke-free wh /sox!Smoke free for a long time,whole organization!Thank you!

Looking over my statement, I note a few typos that ID thieves always cause!I am a published author by good publishers&amp; a researcher,writer,
teacher in college and other schools for at least 46 years;I'm a good,trained typist too--my mother wanted me to take a course in typing in
Draughon's BusinessCollege inDallas,as I did.So the typos you see in some of these tweets are caused by ID thieves,who are always hacking in
Its always them "too good to be true" ass niggas 😒😕 ain't got time.
@NaughtySec well everybody loves fucking and good companionship is well hard to find, I feel ya on the sex though, without it stress boils
and who are sickening,sickening perfs who follow me around to ruin me and take everything,including my life!I do continue to need help fromlaw enforcement that isn't being bribed by them and on their drugs!Thanks to the DEA, the sheriff,the police here and in Scotland Yard,&amp; the
Ohmygod 😂😂😂
local fire department (and the one inHP,Dallas,earlier),the earlier FBI,particularly in Dallas for telling me I am a victim of ID theft when
thieves flooded my condo so strangely in 2004!Thanks to all of them and others and particularly my dear mother,who was beaten by them,and
Low

My killer ID thief is almost toally in charge of my computer after he hacks in!I need law enforcement to arrest him and to please get his
Sold a quart of blood and bought a half pint of scotch@mfrantre off my computer!He has had people break in and use my computer and erase the keys' identity,too,on it and program the strength
@mfrantre damages one's eyesight!There is very little, in the way of murder, he hasn't thought of!
@mfrantre with which one has to touch the keys to type a complete word!This causes carpal tunnel syndrome!Delaying me on the computer also

@RGrich15 @Cardinals let's get this home opener!

What I'm not open to is journalists speaking like experts. (2/n)
I'm not fully in favor of #NetNeutrality because I don't think the Internet is a utility. But I'm open to other views. (1/n)
...being denied a fundamental right! (4/n)
One journo says Internet is a right under the Constitution. I wonder if he realized that 80% of India is then... (3/n)
That Madonna - Drake stuff just looks all sorts of wrong
Gander mountain got me for 80I'll explain why I don't care that much for #NetNeutrality in India: it's a problem of too few. It's a problem, yes. (6/n)
And what's his basis for saying that? Any understanding of the Constitution? SC judgments? Nope, just his holy opinion. (5/n)
The only valid reason I can see for #NetNeutrality is that it creates an unlevel playing field for start-ups. (8/n)
@LakeJanders leaving champaign just bought a new real and shit
But it affects so few people in such a minuscule way, it doesn't deserve much attention. The country has bigger problems. (7/n)
As should be the many other problems that make running businesses in India a nightmare. (10/n) n=10
#MadonnaTasteLike spoilt milk and booty flakes
That's a genuine problem, one that affects the wider economy. And so it should be solved. (9/n)
Anyone wanna buy my kayak for 100, brand new paid 220 last year
.@IlliniBaseball now #11 http://t.co/sehNonquLG Going for sweep over @PurdueBaseball 6p on @wdws1400 @IlliniHQ @learfieldsports
You never know how much you actually care for someone until you let them go.
Read a great article on how @ncbn is trying to bring industry to his new state from Kar and TN. (1/n)
In North &amp; East India, a progressive CM is one who appeases minorities while running the state to ruin. Eg, Jyoti Basu. (3/n)
The article called him a progressive CM. Astounding how that means something completely different in South &amp; West India! (2/n)
One comment said that AP has no realistic chance of catching up to Blore and Hyd in 10 years. That's true. (4/n)
But I think the CM is looking much beyond 10 years. This is the 4th capital for the Andhra People, they know patience. (5/n)
Wish I could say the same for Telangana. How long Hyd will last on Naidu's legacy is anybody's guess. (7/n)
@jutessler @yourpoetrysucks e faz o teste do pokemon inicial!
With an energetic go-getter of a CM and Modi's Make in India, the future is bright for AP. I am very optimistic. (6/n)
As for Bangalore, another term for the Congress should cement its decline. (8/n) n=8@toninhoevc @jutessler @yourpoetrysucks falei pra ela ontem... Se ele falar que não conhece pokemon blz, pior é escolher Bulbasaur

@LoNeGoOsE75 Hey, have you heard anything from Joseph, @Sport_Guy7 ? He was posting some kooky tweets yesterday. Hope he's ok.
possible employer: "we'll let you know our decision on monday"

@LoNeGoOsE75 @Sport_Guy7 Looks like he took down those tweets, saying know-one cared about him and he was leaving twitter. Very cryptic?

David ain't no good. What kind of bff was she.
My neck,my back,my dick and my sack @TaylerBurnett
I'm open to new friendships but it's gon take a while for me to open up to em.
That's why I personally have trust issues with females. Building friendships with females is so hard to do.
Pancakes. Hash browns. Smoked ham. Scrambled eggs. Enough said.
Ugh this season finale was so good!
It's so devastating finding out that your bff have feelings and had relations with your guy. I feel for Mary Jane.
👀 waiting for season 3. Any minute now 😂

@woolie Even there BRT was expected to be more cost effective and wasn't an apples-to-apples comparison. More traffic separation for LRT.
@alon_levy Is that an ethnic thing? Or, just if the wedding was in a synagogue?Lolol these two ladies literally just walked in front of my car when I was turning stupid ass bitches
@woolie If someone did automated LRT (rails might make it easier), I could see that being an interesting argument.

Wut summa dem don' realize is dat we now hava a multibillion dollarlawsuit over different states and different companies and establishements
Does 30% rain mean the probability it will rain during the hour or the percentage of raining time during the hour?
So we simply got thru wid alla da elderly abuse,including the whining noise dat keeps me  and others  up all nite!So we will proceed,and
believe me,lawyers DO know there's lotsa money in it,as much as da mob eveh dreamed of frm drug deals,"offing" people and wuteveh!And if yurfm Europe,it may be a disadvantage ta tink yur hot stuff in a town da mob has controlled in daU.S. fer ages!Also,if yu are in sports and hav
anyting at all to do wid coachin'children or playin' wid kids' teams,yu betteh watch yur step w. r. t. pedophile charges!Also, if yu play BB
BB in da west,yu may be naive about alla da ACL,leg,and calf injuries dat players in da east hav had from attacks on da field!in FB in da
east,too!Lotsa law enfforcement is investigatin' dese tings!Ah wanna find out just how Paul George's calf injury occurred in datMemphis game
last nite!Ah asx player health and safey committees in Congress ta look inta it!Ah hav no more respect for da memphis team,bu ah wuza a fanBecausa Indiana's injuries from which the team was cumin'bak,they had to pull up and couldn't play as usual,knowing that Memphis is a tough
team!(The mob now has a whining noise in here,keeping me awake.This kinda strong arm antic may be oveh now!The DEA,the sheriff,the police--
that I don't include certain law enforcement here among those helping stop these elderly,child and other abusers!)I find that a Mutt &amp; Jeff
typea relationship wid one vera tall person and one vera short oneCUD indicate dat sumone in it-maybe both-are pedophiles!Mayb notbu'it odd!
Good luck to my mommy in surgery, this morning! I know you're stuck there for two days, but everything will be okay. ❤️
If ya high-tail it ta Europe or elswhere ta play ta escape da "long arm of da law" here,it not gonna hep b'cuz many of dese organizations Rinternational in scope &amp; operation!Drugs are an international phenomenon and business and will be controlled and shut down!Bu'lemme emphsize
woke up at 5:30 and rode a early bus to lexis. thats commitment. #bestbff
dat when ya hav an east and west teamplaying like las nite,da west don' know how sum ACL and related injuries hav occurred and may be naive!
Ah note dat sum tuff players about whom people hav wondered if dey cause bad injuries dat take players out for a long time were not playin'
in certain games last nite and kin make arrangements for bad hits on unsuspecting players!Don't play naive!Suspect ones who do hurt others&amp;
by all means go oveh da calf injury last nite to recovering Paul George and how Hibbert was literally thrown down and hurt,thrown down wid
"Throwback Thursday" with a classic pic of the Greatest LB of All Times &amp; ILLINOIS Alum, Dick Butkus.#OSKEE15 http://t.co/iuKJBY1qkAda use of BOTH hands!Go oveh dese tings wid da league!Sue when yu kin!Git sanctions vs such players when yu can,even preventing dem to play
in playoff games!Tuff,mean stuff in da game is ilegal and shud be met wid tuffness in da law!Good season,good Pacers!Also had wanted ta
mention and thank stuckey for his good playing in da 4rh Q!Pacers were brave and neveh shrunk from da task of winnin'!Ah also wanna asz alla
da African-American players to NOT be unaware of black history in and around Memphis,something that Europeans and white may think is not so
important these days because it;s over;it's not over!It;s everywhere--just ask Missouri!Just ask the main police officer of the U.S.!@comcastcares Internet cuts in and out for the last 3-4 weeks. I work from home a lot. I have reset my modem countless times. What can I do?

What are you doing tomorrow between 5 and 8pm?  If you say nothing, you're wrong because you're coming to PhiSig's philanthropy dinner.
Oh, the eternal crown prince of India #RahulReturns! Let us put out the diyas and start a festival to mark this day. (1/n)
So if you like really bomb food then you should really be at our chapter house tomorrow! 💙💛
On a more serious note, what's the point of his returning? Who actually believes he can change anything? (3/n)
We're having pulled pork and mac n' cheese!  All proceeds go to the Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation which supports school and college readiness.
Multiple assembly elections and two general elections are quite a lot of testing, I should think. (5/n)
I don't know what Sheila aunty meant when she said Rahul is untested. He is very much tested. Defective piece. (4/n)
@dunningmatthew @darrenrovell well their games will always sell out regardless
And of course, #Presstitutes have lined up to welcome him. Probably want their delayed payments cleared. (6/n)So this older woman comes in and I shit you not her last name is. Forever Unbeloved.
@dakota_davis_ on a scale of 1-10 it would have been like a -6, thanks.
Now the IV is gone. Just gotta shower &amp; change. Got my stuff, just gonna chill &amp; wait for towels and for the show I'm watching to be over
Anyway Rahul Baba, Bihar elections are coming. Do lead on, the BJP needs you badly! (7/n) #RahulReturns
I never really expected people with Arts degrees to understand a mathematical metaphor anyway. #ModiinCanada

@mciszek @kshockey04 right.  But,  there is nothing that REQUIRES a FIELD to have accrediting.  Just,  if one does, then CHEA etcHBD @sophfrazier http://t.co/5leSyWAYA9

@LukeJett hey man so...what the hell?
I love Cory Crawford I really do. But can we maybe please start the guy that's 6'5 and takes up half the net?
Scott Darling will start game 3...The last 2 did it. Keep in mind the goal is to win one on the road. We did that. Let's get them at home.

31 takes of her lifting the car lock. Bob goes, “which u like?” and I said “one and two.” Chazz Palmintieri gets a laugh at #Ebertfest2015#Ebertfest2015 Chazz Palmintieri said the craps game in "A Bronx Tale" used real money and real wiseguys who kept disappearing the cash.

Hopefully it won't rain it out? Enjoy the day. Don't worry about the flag! You'll b fine.Made some phone calls last night apparently....😳
Pain can make you stronger. Fear can make you braver. Heartbreak can make you wiser.
Listen without defending; speak without offending.
Faith in God changes everything.
Judge me when you're perfect, shut up when you're not@4everlove 私信吧
Today is the youngest you're ever going to be, but today is also the oldest you have ever been. Make the most of it.
it's almost May and i'm still fat 😂😂😂
Never be afraid of change. You may lose something good, but you may gain something even better
You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.
What has gone in the past may not come back, but God can replace it with something better for you.
You don't have to feel bad just because the situation is bad. Don't let your happiness depend on the circumstance.
@MarzellaL I aim to please and I please nobody
Open your mind before your mouthI've worked too hard to quit now.
People sit around and try to change their past, when they have their entire future to look forward to.
I've realized that small changes eventually add up to huge results.
Of course it's hard. It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it. Hard is what makes it great.
Ladies know your worth, don't ever come 'second' in his life when you're good enough to be 'first' in someone else's. 💯💯
Realize what's real and what's not. Who's worth the effort and who's not.
No one notice your tears, No one notice your sadness, No one notice your pains, But they all notice your mistakes.
@bamasevere Thanks for ruining it! :)
Just because you’re attractive, doesn’t mean you’re my type💯💯✌🙋God will send someone who knows how to #love and care for your heart the way you have always desired!
@_0dc OK
@danawhite only fair way to settle it jacre vs rockhold for title elimination.  They will have exactly same layoff. Jacre was#2 &amp; Rockhold 4
Gods ways are not mans ways-  learn to trust the journey even when you don’t understand it
Happy I woke up to my alarm bc I need to shower &amp; shave, but sad bc i'M SO TIRED
@danawhite then there is no doubt the winner gets title shot! But Weidman will beat all of them.
Let your heart be #healed by the love of God!!
When you pray for #strength- God will allow you to walk through a struggle! You win!
Tough times don’t last – tough people do! #GodHasYou
You will never change your life until you change something you do daily.
@_0dc 还是私信吧。不然地址找起来麻烦Beautiful message for this Sunday. Enjoy the day with your Family &amp; Loved Ones. Give Thanks.#OSKEE15 http://t.co/1jEaGQD579
You find out who's truly there for you when you reach hard places in life. Even if you end up being disappointed, it's better to know.
Life's too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So, love the people who treat you right and forget about the ones who don't.
A good woman wants you, your time, your attention and your love. Give her those things and watch her love you like no other.You've done it before and you can do it now. See the positive possibilities.

@zulily who really are hungry!I am glad if they responded to my complaiints about that show's ad.Otherwise,sum of the show may be funny!
Finally,there is one really good ad on TV now that young people do on non-smoking!"Nice face,nice waist but with a big "X" over her pic,

what drew me in to C-SPANyesterday.One of theOklahhoma delegation here mentioned how people all remember where they were when a)Pearl Harbor
was attacked in 194l,b) when Kennedy was shot,and c)when Oklahoma City was so tragically attacked.I don't think ANY of them could recount
where they were for ALL 3 of those tragedies!I can!I myself can and hav online.Re theOklahoma bombing,I was living inDallas,where I was bornand everything there and in Ft.Worth just stopped and stayed that way a long time,especially where our federal buildings were concerned!As

Don't ask why people keep hurting you, instead ask yourself why you keep allowing it to happen.
My hands want to let you go.
My feet want to walk away.
My mind wants to forget you,
But my heart protest, it still loves you.
When I get hurt, something inside me just shuts off.
Light a fire on the inside. You have the seed of Almighty God. Don't allow something small to keep you from God's best.
You haven't failed until you quit trying.
I fall, I rise, I make mistakes, I live, I learn, I've been hurt but I'm alive. I'm human, I'm not perfect but I'm thankful.
Dream big today! God said that He will do exceedingly, abundantly above what we could ask, think or imagine.

"jets on da runway here!"Le's keep http://t.co/Ow5t594Xmh!" ya know,ah hurd a few minutes of Hilary's Iowa speech and the first prearranged
question someone in Iowa asked her,which was,natrually,about children and their importance.No complaint from me,BUT we need someone in the
House who has served in the military,preferab;y in a responsibel command!This is,today and always, paramount!One can't get that experienceany other way,reallly!You can learn a lot about it secondhand but not how to wage war actually,and,therefore,peace except firsthandd!Itseems
like sucha strong prerequisite in today'spresidency and always!I am a strong McCain type of person when it comes to our militarypreparedness
and we now have a number of good female military officers who can be strong presidential candidates!I think,especially right now,that
experence is essential,not that I don't admireHillary and know she has a good,strong legal background.But her Presidency wuld not be like,speaking of Queen Elizabeth,theQueen's good rule alongside a husband who had served long and well in high positions in the military.Also,I
for one,despite no one's mentioning it any more,including "Meet the Press," whose disjunctive format last Sunday should be replaced with the
format that one can follow easily--a panel that appears and comments throughout--the old format that worked for deades!I for one,as I was
trying to say,am still very in need of real explanations of what was in those 30.000 deleted e-mails of Hilary's!It was an unusual security
breach,no matter what anyone else may say!Those who mght support her for President should know!We see more and more weird stuff coming tolite now via alla da "sexual harrassment" and "sexual misconduct"in some of our most trusted law enforcement organizations inDCand elsewhere

@bibliolaura well,  they will have to decide whether to have shape practice.  theory not obligatory.
@bibliolaura I for example think the six concepts in FW useful, just incomplete and not TC.
