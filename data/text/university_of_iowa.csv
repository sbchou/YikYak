Kentucky Is going to Lose so I have 0 worries 😈
Flagrant 1 here we come
No call lmfao... The refs love #kentucky
Well think we know who the NCAA wants to win....
@Hlas except for at the other end of the floor....
Wow😐 he smacked him
Gabe got a flagrant 2 earlier in the season for way less contact than that.
It's pretty apparent, the refs want Kentucky to win
Well I guess they really want a Kentucky win tonight.
Refs got money on the game #GoBig10
Sconnie gettin fucked deep and hard with no lube
Can someone explain to me how that wasn't a flagrant 1 or 2 and how that was a charge? The officials are in Kentucky's pockets. Weird

@ZachJohnsonPGA @jakepar44 Watching on TruTH so I don't have to listen to CBS announcers.
@ZachAtzen they can't call personal fouls based off replay, but they can call flagrant 1's and 2's from replay review
“@bomani_jones: but wow, that was a bad bad bad call.”  Sooo many bad calls!
Should have been a shot clock violation
uhhhohh!!
what the fuck is Kentucky doing
And that would be a $5000 fine on dekker
@TrojanSoBball horrible officiating!
@ZachAtzen yes, why else would they spend time watch the replay if you couldn't do that? Haha
This is one hell of a game
If one of the Harrison's hit a 3 I'm going to kill someone
@ZachAtzen no, to see if the play required a flagrant 1 or 2, and if it happened to be a 2 it would also result in an ejection
@sweatpantspapi I'm fed up fam
I wouldn't mind this game going into overtime.
LIKE I SAID BYE BYE KENTUCKY 😈😈😈
This game is just too damn good. Whoever wins tonight deserves the championship. Such a fun game to watch.The first champions league is on Netflix... My life is complete

Cubbies on pace to lose 162. For the record.
The Cards beat the Cubs 3-0 on Opening Night, mathematically eliminating the Cubbies from playoff contention for 2015.
There's always next year

It's heartbreaking that @CPuff_Real and I didn't get our annual Easter pic. #sadtweet
@NSelbs with being good.
@NSelbs agree 100%. All I hear from Card fans around here is how all Cubs fans are DB's, yet thy don't realize they do the same stuff.
@NSelbs I get annoyed by Cubs fans as well. So I get what you're saying.
@DanKrauss @NSelbs yeah it annoys the hell out of me. Just cheer and support your team. You don't have to try and tear down other teams.
I really tried.
@DanKrauss @NSelbs so many "fans" have no knowledge of the game, so they have to resort to talking crap.

Worst call ever
What a fitting end to theNCAA season. Great game ruined by horrendous officiating!
How is that Duke ball?!?! You have got to be kidding me. This is unreal.
Not at all cheering for Wisconsin but that was there ball

I wanted Wisconsin to win but I wont lose any sleep over Duke winning. For real tho this whole tournament was officiated horribly.#Atrocious
@JacqueseP24 but anyways Coach K is a great coach...
Yessssssssasssssas DUKE!
@JacqueseP24 @jayybo22 @king_Leach1 did you not see this nigga touch the ball or nah?
I bet the SEW 2013 basketball team could beat Duke. #nodaysoff @TheeShawn_Piel @zachhart9
@king_Leach1 @jayybo22 they beat kentucky fare nd sqaure. This nigga clearly touched the ball tho
💔😭
@jayybo22 @king_Leach1 okay but did that nigga clearly not touch the ball?
@king_Leach1 @jayybo22 why not. Lol
"He wasn't from tinder he was from Summit" "OH because that's better"
Every time I see sad sports fans I just want to remind them that nothing matters and we will all die alone
@Kellshann @stephkoch9 @lilgalvin667 @KatieBindon @kdempsey21 @gigi_harrold I said "oh shit" at first bc i though it was gonna be a vis pic
@JacqueseP24 @jayybo22 @king_Leach1 answer the question?
Anyone still impressed by that intensely dissected replay?
@JacqueseP24 the one on the left. Its the championship game
Or what about that fu ass charge call @JacqueseP24 ?

@trentcondon @CBTonNBC Didn't open link, but I assume that means UAB is preseason #1??
@JacqueseP24 @jayybo22 @king_Leach1 dats not true the championship game is more important so that call is more important than d shot clock
It was quieter in the Main Lounge during the game than in the River Room afterwards
@bekdale Agreed. Just get to One Shining Moment!
@king_Leach1 @JacqueseP24 @jayybo22 where was Kentucky at tonight?
@king_Leach1 @JacqueseP24 @jayybo22 not really?

@TheRoot can we call him "Crackerham"
White: Derrick Mitchell couldn't be tackled when replicating Melvin Gordon on scout team. Mitchell broke off big runs in Saturday practice.
Chris White says clearing up punter is a priority. Marshall Koehn getting reps at punter, so is Miguel Recinos
White: clearly the No. 1 thing in program is getting punt game sorted out. Marshall Koehn competing at punter as well with Kidd/Kornbrath.

@cpalmisano1200 Sure, Illinois could be a deeper team (fourth starter losses you mentioned), but Iowa has had losing BT w/l 21 of 24 years.
@cpalmisano1200 And in only his second season they're tied for the Big Ten lead, 5/6 wins vs Ind/Mary, setup for a NCAA tourney? That's COY.

I think Spieth is gonna be really fun once he settles in with the media. You can tell he's trying really hard to present the right image.
hoodie allen is at usd and i'm missing it
It's great to see him so grounded and polite with everyone who interviews him. Speaks well of his character (or media coach).
You could tell in that Letterman interview tho that he is witty and gas a good sense of humor. Will be fun once he really let's loose.

@garyrogers ಠ_ಠ@bryan_horwath He'd be a great addition there protecting Bridgewater or possibly opening holes for AP (if he returns). Be a good fit, too
@Stevemontana @bscherff68 Yeah it's tough on the ones who slide late in first round or second round. A few have done that over the years.

Swung over a couple pitches but that was a much better at bat by Soler. Love seeing these guys work deep into counts.
@nissen54 ugly 1st period, good thing the Cubs are doin work
That pitch was begging to be in the bleachers. Still an RBI.@CarleyHuisenga @laikj @pipe_roach I wish I remembered😂😂😂

Gotta respect all the backwards K's the Reds are racking up tonight

@scotgregor or he couldve challenged the play.  Either or.
Listerine has really taken child proofing to the next level.
@scotgregor DET broadcast had an angle where he got him.  Announcers were baffled there was no challenge.
Ventura the player was fun but Ventura the manager is a train wreck.

Logan Huntzberger is the reason I have unrealistic expectations of men.

Also that women skate boarding showed ankle. She'll probably get stoned.
@CodyWesterlund and the ump is looking right at it.  Baffling.@CSNHayes lololol.  Challenging there has no downside.   What a rube.
Never thought there'd be a coach/manager worse at using challenges than Mike McCarthy, but Robin Ventura is breaking new ground.

What is going on in Nashville? 3 goals in 2:19, 6-2 Predators
Welp at least it's only 1 game.
So that's 9 goals given up by Crawford in 4 periods of play. Yikes. A few of them were pretty soft too. I think Darling deserves a shot.

Would suspect Hickman might be done after 93 pitches. His line: 6 IP, 0 R, 5 H, 2 BB, 2 Ks. Hawkeyes lead Northwestern 7-0, mid-6th.

Also shout out to @Dana_Weinstein for helping me pick out groceries when I was crying at HyVee ❤️Blake Hickman finishes his day (more than likely) by pitching out of trouble in 7th. He goes 7 scoreless IP, 6 H, 3 BB, 3 Ks, 115 pitches.

@jfin4 I love Like, but Garth is Garth. No one is a better entertainer/singer than Garth! He should've won.
Garth Brooks doesn't even have 200k Twitter followers. Luke Bryan over 4 million. Fan vote in Twitter world - easy to see why he won.
I ❤️ Homemakers! Can't wait until our new bed arrives in 3 weeks! #thinkGod #Homemakers
@bryan7berg you basically asked for it...
@Miaaemilyy hashtag me.
Check out the CNN story on snapchat. Whatever your taste, there's no way it should be schedule 1. A millennia of medical research proves it
Garth still blows anyone in country music out of the water when it comes to a live show.

That is such a smart counter challenge by Joe Maddon. He is going to win this.
But will the Pirates challenge the challenge of the challenge?
Hahahahaha a challenge has NOT gone our way once this season. Unreal actually
Hey USAA, time for a new commercial perhaps?
I'd love to see the "conclusive evidence" they used to overturn that. Then I'd love to hear the argument for how he wasn't blocking home.
@sara_lnr @paranoiaaffair since white facepaint doesn't have the minstrel show history blackface does, i'm pretty sure that's not the case

@LeahKitsis I used my context clues and figured it out thanks though!!
When Rizzo tossed that ball I thought Rosscup fielded it with his bare (right) hand. Then I remembered lefties exist. I'm a moron.
I'd probably pay to see a hobo dragging one down the street to return it though

If I were predicting B1G basketball like Goodman just did I'd go 1) Maryland 2) MSU 3) Indiana 4) Purdue 5) Michigan 6) Wisconsin 7) Iowa
@MarkDeeksNBA @GoodmanESPN made the short list for Ennis too.  They land him and everything changes.
That's not to say I don't think Iowa will climb because they're capable. But with a huge recruiting class it's so hard to predict success.
Good lord is it summer break yet?
Goodman doesnt have Purdue in his top 5 because no Octeus.  I feel like Thompson/Mathias can hold it down.  Get another shooter on the floor
@DeLanaHarvick you looking nice as always.  Nice with two on your arm lolEvery single time I wake up I have some random song stuck in my head
MD, MSU, and Indiana have landed huge recruits, Michigan gets Walton/LaVert healthy, Purdue kept Hammons, and Wisconsin still has Bo Ryan.
OSU looks to be way down from normal but Matta can still coach and they'll be competitive. Basically what I'm saying is,  B1G is deep again.
A Mathias/Cline/Davis/Edwards/Hammons lineup has no holes in theory.  Solid defense and plenty of spacing for AJ.
@kendal_lake thank you Kendal 💕😍 I better be seeing you a lot this summer!!
Another day closer to friday 🙇
Also, nobody talking about Iowa might be a good thing. Who was talking about Maryland before last season? Gives them a chip on the shoulder.

Enlightening stuff as always, Jon.  https://t.co/TdX2VAc9c8
@KMetz40 you could start making gainz.

I can't listen to main stream music anymore fr
@moonfangman except for killer whales
Drank 40 dollars worth of 2 dollar margaritas last night. I'm the worst
@Riles23 definitely true. If Dale Jones is the stretch 4 Fran wants him to be it should allow Uthoff space to work, Jok space to drive.

To B1G writers who say "White, Olaseni are big losses, etc." Everyone lost players. Just be honest and say "I don't know their recruits."
Because if you still like Wisc as a title threat losing Gasser, Kaminsky, Dekker, Dukan your reason must be the players they have coming in.CHANDLER I FEEL U http://t.co/HQXZDGitIh
Iowa doesn't have a bunch of top 100 recruits. There, that's your reason. Fine. But just saying they lost important players is lazy.

I think people who have similar tastes in books make the best couples, or the most successful couples.
Like if you've read the same things then it's like you both been in the same world for a while and situations seem more familiar.
Any time you see NFL players go to a team like Arizona or Miami after age 30, it's all over. Except Kurt Warner (Jesus).
@Stef_Sanchezz  https://t.co/SGHhVBrdfD
And according to psychological research, successful couples are usually people who are very similar to one another in all aspects
@Stef_Sanchezz 😭💔
Which is also why long-term couples start looking like each other.
@schneiderbrett9 @MarissaKossoff @tscrim yes, yes I did do that once 😂
And people are more likely to be attracted to people who are similar to them or who wish they were similar to.

given their respective reputations, i thought the luky cup would be a step up from the diva cup. but now i'm not sure that's the case 4 me.
it also shifts/drops more when i'm wearing it? like sometimes if i do something wonky suddenly it's out of place.
the lily cup is much harder for me to insert comfortably even after three periods, and it's not any easier to remove.
#regrets
this is a big shame bc my diva cup was DISGUSTING so i threw it away expecting the adjustment period to be shorter.
