@Drew_Radners77 @spierjac000 @AlexaLynn33 girls sports are a joke besides soccer girls need to stop trying to be men
@Drew_Radners77 @spierjac000 @AlexaLynn33 compared to mens volleyball baseball and basketball 100% those are jokes

Do Duke get every call ever? Asking for a friend!
#NBLNataliaVoto🌞🌞
"guys love it when you can show them you're better than them at something they love"
Tyus you dog
The fact that since the 6 minute mark 7 Wisconsin players hit the deck and 0 Duke fouls was called is just crazy... But hey idc anyways

@Mario_Colosimo Duke is simply better, Wisconsin had a chance but they weren't really gonna win that game
@natnat582 and I posted it in confidence 😂 I'll make it up to you by listening to him all night also 😂

Instead of studying I printed a color picture of dates and pinned it to an envelope filled with cards for calendar dates.
#NBLNataliaVoto2
It's an absolute travesty that officiating would play such a major role in a championship game.
@JordanVaughn174 it's going around! And my allergies prob don't help thx vry much jvt
#NBLNataliaVoto🐞
I will spend tonight making a conscious effect not to think about how Duke truly does have it all.
you don't even care and it fucking sucks
#NBLNataliaVoto🐝
#GoBlue “@TheRealTyy_: GET READY FOR IT  https://t.co/lHNJxv30Vq”

I honestly believe in my heart that Wisconsin would've won if not for those two blown calls.
Duke I hate you still.
#NBLNataliaVoto7#NBLNataliaVoto🐒
@Mario_Colosimo not that many Wisconsin was holding a lead with a team of upperclassmen wit some years on em losting to a gang of freshmen
#NBLNataliaVoto🐯
OMG perfect bracket!!!!! #jk
#NBLNataliaVoto🐜
Also, I fucking hate Greyson Allen's face.
#NBLNataliaVoto🐛

🙌 https://t.co/x72mX0Up68
Duke winning the ntl championship is kinda like an Adam Sandler movie- nobody really wants it and it happens way more often than we'd like
Tyus and Justise were the best 2 players for Duke all tourny... But the guy who can't hit free throws is considered the top pick #duke
I did pick duke as my winner tho
Not a duke fan at all, but good game they earned it 🏆🙌💯 #finalfourchampionship
That sucks man Wisconsin chocked
Can't decide which I hate more Duke or Coach K
Well, just another day of doing nothing productive whatsoever
I wanted Wisconsin to win but I still picked Duke. At least I win in my bracket challenge though http://t.co/w09GAmVIXh
@Mario_Colosimo idk man Wisconsin put themselves in position besides one out of bounds call that went dukes way Wisconsin kinda lost it
@Dusty_Darling I owe you some Dairy Queen man..
This nigga erique cold at singing 😈
@localky awww that just made my day 😘 thanks gorgeous 😎🙈
@sarahlew14 incredibly relevant  https://t.co/nDMLmQGADc
Wisconsin fans should be thanking the refs they took out Oakafor and Winslow not Dukes fault they have too many elite players
Jared lost 200 lbs eating Subway... I eat Jimmy Johns almost everyday. Waiting for results.
@TonySoSuave he Aint role player material
Nigga we made it TYBG
Of course when I don't put a lot of money on my bracket, I do better than 99.1% of all brackets #BasketballWizard #MarchMadness
@chairkicker ECMAscript 9 lets the font outlines represent truthiness as a settable (but not inheritable) attribute
@K10Yarows good thing you're a part time Duke fan

@Mario_Colosimo an best guard play in the tournament
Feels odd to be using this title header on papers already. Hopefully this is where I'll be in a few years. #goals http://t.co/JQM1R0eugO
@Mario_Colosimo idk Wisconsin was gonna lose it eventually cuz a bunch of freshman put work on em
One shining moment #cantwait-bartscott#gothprom @ Necto Nightclub https://t.co/eo16XwIp5w
At the end of the day my bracket was 95.6%
I FUCKING HEAR YOU IN THE BACKGROUND FALL OUT BOY
#gothprom I might be tipsy @ Necto Nightclub https://t.co/NK2i1TDNfo
At first I tried not to listen, but now I understand why Lmfao
I have a problem with the calls at the end but I have a bigger problem with how these Duke players are carrying scissors. #safety101

Shit J you'd have a ring if you were 6 feet @JackGardner_
I've never laughed so hard before in my entire life 😂😭
@nbamark that'll fondue it.
@Mario_Colosimo when Wisconsin has more experience an the mvp of college they should keep a 9 pt lead an not give it all up to one kid
@Cturz flop flop flop
I hate duke so much it's incredible. Okafor is overrated and if refs called charges by the book he'd have one on every single post up.
Wow https://t.co/J7MHbsVAeX
@Cturz It makes me sad that we now add that to someone's skill in the game.
@j_pit76 cargo shorts? GDI
@Dusty_Darling dude you bought be one last year, so I'll get you one this year. And then on and off for the next 50 years?
@TonySoSuave damn him then
🍍💕 aw the pineapple emoji is so cute and you're so gorgeous and I really like your tweets
@asociologist they're showing it for free on Thursday at 6 in Rackham!
@Mario_Colosimo the officials were bad but bad both ways
@Cturz just take the contact. If it's enough to knock you down okay. If not then don't go down.
Bo making excuses
Bo Ryan complaining about a physical game not getting called is... I can't even think of something that ironic.
If any1 knows the whereabouts of the WVHS/SEHS Taft storm the court video(the one where I eat shit)pls notify me im trying 2 make friends
I am retweeting every tweet with a picture of the Wisconsin Teletubby. #po #MarchMadness
@Cturz played great on offense though and he deserves it for that.
where r my friends where is the alcohol
@PhilMackey especially considering how few calls go against Wisconsin's hand-check D

@iSlander_Hoes she was referring to feminists
Treating Greeks as the virus in a host is a very narrow view of the system when in all actuality Greek Life is a host of the greater disease
@Salute__Beauty that's planet fitness
Yes,  I also understand I'm not a physician and the nature of a virus is that you have to let it pass or cure it but...go with me.
If we have disease or public health concerns = alcohol, sexual assault, racism shouldn't we be attacking the virus and not the host.
@RiotMagus Not sure if you're the guy to ask, but do you know the rules for cosplaying at the MSI? My gf and I were planning to do some
I forget just how beautiful my gf is sometimes 😩😍
The cure to the greater host isn't killing host cells within it. It's a cure for the virus itself = alcohol, sexual assault, racism = coping

Seriously, if you like Hillary you may want to unfollow me now. I'm the evil Conservative your profs warned you about. Fair warning.
@BCAppelbaum @UpdatedPriors wait, Ryan are you saying that gov't programs couldn't suppress wages? Where's your counterfactual?
@BCAppelbaum @UpdatedPriors or are you saying the burden of evidence is on the journalists because they are making this claim?

@Noahpinion so I obviously agree on capital and consumer debt issuance, maybe that yields your average benefitBegin your week right! Breakfast open at 8am #annarbor http://t.co/Ru3sUN5POV
@Noahpinion lots of derivatives (but not all), tax arbitrage, reg arbitrage are totally wasteful and are often harmful
@DNR_Rogo @VivaTigres @jkaras Deer had a bobble head day in Milwaukee.  What about the same for Higgy? #ItsTime http://t.co/0O2DNgMEL7
@zcresp12 @Dusty_Darling 50 years worth...
@Noahpinion so I was including IB in capital issuance and mortgage underwriting in consumer debt, you're def right on retail banking and VC
@Noahpinion also, not clear to me that short-term traders add much if any value
It aint nothin boo 😉😘✨💕👑  https://t.co/Mca1eEDyUz
@Noahpinion I'm sure derivatives are a bit overblown because of the notional value of the contracts
@LinkYeWest go to fucking sleep.
high five dood
@KK_rich_ko just used her selfie stick to reach over to my bed and take a picture of me #leavemealone #creep
@Noahpinion yup, how often do companies do secondary offerings?
@Noahpinion activists more than PE imo. PE often does well w/o actually improving the company
@LinkYeWest or you can talk to me you seem to enjoy that lol.
@Noahpinion but this is like quarterly or annually at most
@Noahpinion I can concede that. I also think Milken did a lot of good and gets a bad rap.

@WXYZPrakash Good Morning!
Artis leaves me the cutest voice notes♡@Nastyness61 Good Morning! Nice picture. Have a good one.
So, you know when you start writing something, and the best you can do is define a topic?
Was talking with @jennisifire and @CFrilingos the other day about something, and I'm still wondering whether there's a name for it.
When I'm in that crossover, the first few iterations are usually pretty simple: that is, my arguments are on the order of:
Then, in subsequent drafts, treatment of the the topic (passive reporting) morphs into presentation of an argument (active contributing).
Usually, at that point, I start trying to back-form a writing prompt for myself; or, really, to form better, a more specific prompt.
Ypsilanti is its own entity. It must have its own CVB. #visitypsilove
"So-and-so has been wrong about this!" or "It's not X, it's Y." or (my favorite self-deception) "This is very interesting!"
I'm, at that point, trying to figure out what type of question my writing is answering, and trying to make a more complex question.
When I write prompts for classes, I make sure to have not just a topic but an actual set of questions, to avoid the report-style essay.
Because that's the hardest part of writing, post course-work, for me: figuring out my own writing prompts for myself.
@lgib15 Good Morning!
When we were talking, @jennisifire had a name for another drafting skill---reverse outlining---and so I wonder:
And, part of the writing process for me is, in later drafts, figuring out what (heretofore latent) prompt I'm answering.
Does this make-a-prompt-for-your-draft thing have a name?
Happy birthday @zoestirrett 🎉🎂 have a great day!!
The project I'm working on now started with a really simple prompt: "Ellen, write a book about death in late ancient Christianity.""Ellen, write about book about what people anticipated about their own deaths in late ancient Christianity."
As I've been working on it, the prompt has shifted. Other people were waaay more informed about ritual and architecture, so my prompt became
Which I could never have gotten to right out of the gate--didn't know enough, didn't know the problems I'm writing about were even things.
And now it's "Ellen, write a book about the ethical orientation late ancient Christians gain when they anticipate death a certain way."
I really wish this kid would get his shit together and only use one outlet
@foxandfriends @FoxNews @marcorubio HE IS A STRONG CONTENDER WITH FORWARD THINKING SIMPLE PLANS #VOTERUBIO
So, apologies for the tweetshower, but anyone got a name for the back-form-your-own-prompt-for-the-next-draft thing?

@Roy_Frontier you have a point here. How do you determine what % is to meat and what % is to dairy for the same cow @Sdnomla@tcarmody which was pretty good
@GracieeMalonee oh ok that's not bad. Is it good quality? I went to one on Ventura before and my screen popped out 😑
@nandelabra but the point is are these products worse than dairy products. I'd say no @Sdnomla @shaneferro
@tcarmody “Help me, Hurley, you’re my only hope.”
@GracieeMalonee oh good! I'll go there then, thank you!
@Roy_Frontier there's an excess supply of cows so the grass has to come from somewhere. Still uses water. @Sdnomla

Ecclesiastes 3:11b
Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.

In the US, white tail deer prefer to "eat local" and chow down on the competition, while trampling soil and spreading garlic mustard seeds.
Europeans brought garlic mustard to the US for herbs and medicine. But on the continent, herbivores eat it. http://t.co/IEdZuNWSwE
My birthday is in two weeks on Monday owo
I don't wanna go to novi 😭
What's worse, garlic mustard plays dirty, secreting "alleochemicals" that interfere with the local mycorrhizal fungi.That feeling when you want cloths but you realize you only have 10 bucks.😭😂😭
Without the "fungal internet" (mycorrhizal fungi), extensions of roots that facilitate nutrient sharing, other plants can't take root.
Since it's spring, garlic mustard has yet to flower. "Manual control" or hand-pulling is best. Get all the root! http://t.co/IejTRSPPhW
Check your local DNR for Stewardship Workdays. Eusocial garlic mustard control. Michigan, for instance: http://t.co/Kb9Kbiy9x4

How to peer mediate with my asm Listen to only one side and yell at the other Then force them on break so they can have a panic attack n cry
Hernandez's second of the day brings it to 8-5 with 14:25 left. #GoBlue
PSU answers right back, now 9-5 with just under 14 to go. #GoBlue
Tapas with a view. #AnnArbor #Aventura 🍷 http://t.co/coBBYSXexR
And then when they try to say something let said other side yell at them and then yell at them for working hard
Stephen A. Smith and Floyd Mayweather seem like they're made for each other. Ugh.
