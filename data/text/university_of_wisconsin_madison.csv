Horrible call by the refs. #badgers #UKvsWIS
#BanCharges @clubtrillion He had released the ball already, BS charge call
HORRIBLE call!
Garbage. That's an integrity questioning call.
@tanehisicoates Watch the Badger stream on TruTV
@debjensen1011 @ZachJensen22 #HipsAndNips
There was a time when the say "The Customer is your money maker and most important part of any business" I guess that no longer is true
Didn't they alter the charge rule so stuff like that wouldn't happen?
Honestly never seen that call. I don't how you can pull that in a national semi
@kstein65 @nerdblizzard That call was bogus. The Harmony is about to revolt.
OMG.....bacon coma....#Jonesdairyfarm@nerdblizzard @kstein65 And this is why I heart dogs.

Wow, refs took this game way over, unbelievable, badgers don't quit though
What game are these refs watching?! @waynelarrivee #onwisconsin
Then you don't have to be set for a charge?
@TubbyEmu someone paid the refs
Fucking hosed
How much they pay you refs, I'm willing to double it
THAT WAS FUCKING BULLSHIT. THAT WAS SO INTENTIONAL
Seriously the NCAA, illuminati
These refs SUCK!!!
That's ridiculous. Officiating is ruining what's otherwise best game of season.
GOOD SIR I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE
So you can slap the shit out of someone and get away with it?!
BULLSHIT
Wow...I know I'm biased but wow

How is that a "no call"? What type of bullshit is that? He got the shit smacked out of his face intentionally 😑😑😑
Go badgers ????? @ madtown 🐾 https://t.co/D5YPL3HHRi
How is hitting somebody in the face NOT a foul but running into someone is. #gohomerefsyouredrunk
Just in case anyone is wondering the last time these refs were on a stage this big was MNF in 2012 between Seattle and GB.. #replacementrefs
Refs stink but need to take it back.#Badgers

Wisconsin could have complained and lost their cool, but never did. Survived 3 offensive rebounds by Towns, no points
Keep sleeping on me@Omundson @therealraywise @MadMen_AMC You and Ray should work together again. 😀
@Matt_Manasse absolutely. Tug at those emotions of why you started to play the game in the first place.
Also,no way Hayes got that off in time before the shot clock ran out. And the refs just called one on Kentucky the previous play

Going for run around Monona got me feelin' very nostalgic
#TruLyfe
If the Badgers win, @YoungDanielSupe promised to get a W tattooed on his ass. Today is going to be a great day. #MakeEmBelieve 👐❤️💃🏀
@gilossal NO!
I have so much shit to do but I'm just sitting here ....
You know you go to Madison when the bars are at capacity at 11am on a Monday.
We got brewers at 1 and wisco at 8. Today is great
@gilossal um foh!
I don't think I've ever been so horny for a game in my life
My professor moved our exam cause of the game 🙏🙏These winky face emojis on snapchat are supposed to indicate who's down &amp; wid it right?
@darby_janss @jen_warner8 the deed is done
Not sure what I want more: Mac and cheese or a nap
@MeCookieMonster @WhiteHouse Cookie... Is there any limit to your awesomeness?
Castro can't be up there with runners on base hacking away like he's trying to hit a five-run homer

Willow and mark killed it ! #DWTS
Duke is beating us at our own game, better defensive intensity. We are also shooting 33% and down only 5.

I will also shit myself if the Badgers lose
I hate Duke. And I hate refs now
Wisconsin down 5. Here we go.
His finger bent. Just know that.
Games like these is why you have to make your free throws.

Stop blaming the refs, we had a 9 point lead and couldn't execute. JUST STOP
Why are the commentators talking about how Duke can hold on?

Great win for the Duke's 😈
Don't Talk About My Wildcats And Think I Won't Say Anything .😂
This is depressing
Two possessions.  Two clear ob's off Winslow.  Ref explanation:  couldn't see. Trudat. Wow.  Hard not to feel robbed.
A gremlin won the game for duke? Really @Duke_ATHLETICS you don't deserve it all you do is pick up the nation's best prospects. Not bball
At least we don't win in the ugly contest...
I'm still proud to be a Badger. #OnWisconsin
Kaminsky &gt; Okafor
First the NFC Championship game now this. Deep cuts
Honestly fuck class tomorrow.
Don't need a walk after this one, we got flat out beat. We had it, lost it, couldn't show up in crunch time. Kentucky was our Championship
I'm bummed but still proud of the badgers. You had one heck of a season. #OnWisconsin
It was an amazing season. Great Job @BadgerMBB
And remember, everyone still hates Duke.
Amazing season. So proud of my team. #badgerforlife
On Wisconsin!
THE TELETUBBY LOOKED SO SAD
Wtf Duke

#Badgers
In my opinion:

Wisconsin &gt; Duke
Rioting in madison
Yo why did Coach K kiss his players
Broken heart but so damn proud #OnWisconsin
Somebody had to win and somebody had to lose but it would have been nice to have been given a fair shake. #Shame on @NCAA  and #MarchMadness
Win or lose I stand by this team. That was hell of a run ! Proud to be a badger @UWMadison
@Bharper3407 I'm no longer your fan
@_juliagooliaa nobody likes you still
#FuckDuke #Wisconsin is the #uncrownedchampion by taking out the #1 team in the tournament
I respect coach K and all but why is he kissing his players 😒
Nothing against Duke and their effort, but that was some of the worst officiating I have ever seen.
Dekker did Dekker things by not showing up in biggest game of life.  A story wisco has seen too many times
Questionably bullshit
glad the refs won that game for duke
I want to hear espn go off on those missed calls but they probably won't bc duke won
Fav song at the moment🙌 https://t.co/REjS976UDX @itsruthb

"@rongiordan: @StortCre8s Awwww...shucks." Badgers made poor decisions down the stretch and played a game that didn't resemble their season.
Dude in the tele-tubby fit hurt.

Only Duke fan in this bitch
It really doesn't matter what happened tonight. This tema is the best we have ever had and I'm glad I stood behind it. #OnWisconsin

@jlundeen16 I'm not saying we played well but there's a 6 point swing on 2 missed calls that's big even if we didn't play well but oh well
So close. So sad. :( #Badgers
You played like National Champs. You act like national champs.  You are a class act. We love our #Badgers always.
If #Duke had the journey the #Badgers had during this tourney, we'd be playing #MSU right now. #FuckDuke #NCAAChampionship #ProudBadger
“@WorldStarFunny: 😕 https://t.co/H1TpZ64zAZ” UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Please don't do stupid shit Badgers, we're better than that
I love you @FSKPart3 @dekker @NIGEL_HAYES @JPGasser21 @BronsonK_24 ❤️❤️❤️ great game boys!! #OnWisconsin #Badgers #class
I'm blowin
Badgers, I love you anyway!!
#USA #Winsconsin #FinalFour #Game #Wewerestrong
Grayson Allen tho...  🏀🏀🏀
No reason for Wisconsin not to have our heads held high tonight.
@jlundeen16 that's supposed to say wasn't lol
Nfl replacement refs would've done better. Over it. Drunk. #OnWisconsin
He touched that ball tho.... This some bullshit. That boy Tyus can ball..
We lost because of Scott Walker lol
Finally get to uninstall pesky NCAA app, at least.  *sigh*
@SimplyAlizabeth cut it lol http://t.co/b05PnRkPjZ
Kentucky game took a lot out of them I think. Now comes the Duke lovefest on ESPN
Duke is who we thought they were, but we let 'em off the hook. I know how Denny Green felt now.
Here comes the "Fuck Duke" riots
" when she calls you "fam" hahaha  https://t.co/5MM2jhaEHT
@Dooglaus burn those shorts
Wisconsin is still the best fucking team in the world
Not too much you can say. Blown calls on both sides. This doesn't define this squad though. We still beat a team that went 38-0.
Actually crying
In life and in basketball, sometimes you put your all in and you lose anyways. Better luck next year Bucky.
Badgers beat Kentucky! Most teams can't claim that! Great season badgers! @BadgerMBB
On a positive note it's likely that today will end up being the worst day in 2015 &amp; every other day will be great by comparison
@_juliagooliaa ur a piece of shit
And referees.  https://t.co/35wCsCV3o4
Hmm Pretty Quiet .
@Nick24Madison @OG_bomo Grayson allen got fouled once the whole fucking game it's all bullshitI'm proud of my Wisconsin Badgers. @UWBadgers They had an amazing season. #BadgerNation 🏀 You're winners in my book.
Oh I Bet You Are😌😂😂 https://t.co/WCAImNalBT
@ShawnRTV6 The refs had one job.  They let us down.  #Badgers
#IHateDuke
I legit don't know what to do now....
😢 I'm going to cry so hard tonight, that should have been our ball
@hunterschultz24 👏
@RemovableMoe the fuck you talking about moody Kentucky got away with 2 personal fouls in the last 5 min of the damn game
@mattripkey @Tsorren33 lolololololololololololololol
@jlundeen16 hahaha I agree I see why we hate each other during the season but afterwords ehhh hahaha
Boys played your hearts out #istillbelieve #badgers
This team has done a lot for Wisconsin. #ThankYouBadgers #ThankYouFrank
You can't spell Dookie the 1994 green day album without Duke the university in north Carolina
New 30 for 30: I hate Tyus Jones
I'm upset, but its nothing compared to after the NFC championship game. This run and this game made me proud.
@06_brunner @its99Percent @KalinWhite we were talking about this in the group dm 😂😂😂😂
No sports radio for me this week.  #npr #badgers
You gave it everything. The scoreboard may say one thing but the boys gave it 100% and if u disagree im disappointed in u as a fan.
Duke don't wanna fight tho #Wisconsin
Don't you just love seeing the same teams win all the time? Let's go BU and/or North Dakota! 😒
There's no way in hell duke would've beat Kentucky
😒✋✋ UW Lost You Guys Are Mad. BYEE https://t.co/AyZWZqsuCn
This @BadgerMBB team will go down in history as one of the best ever. Great group of guys, hard not to love these seniors. We'll be back
Kentucky. http://t.co/TWvMEqEmv5
Oh my heart 💔. But when you say Wisconsin, you've still said it all. #OnWisconsinForever
Frank will have his Wooden, Sam might come back, but you will never give these kids back this shot at the title
The awkward moment when everyone walks to state in sadness instead of running
I'm still proud to be a badger fan 👐 #dirtydubs
@sincerelypatong No I Hate Duke I Just Wanted UW To Lose.
Badgers go to championship = girls get sluttier
Why are the referees on the podium? #Badgers  #Duke
Gotta give credit where it's due and Duke's guards played out of their mind. Great game. Sad way to go out. #sorryBo #thatwasWIballdoe
Sorry I'm not proud of a bunch of mcdonalds all Americans with the refs on their team. Call me bitter
My friends and I just let an anguished scream out into the street. It... It actually made me feel a little better.
At least we're still a more attractive school.
I'm at Ian's Pizza on State - @iansonstate in Madison, WI https://t.co/rGSQ2p2zDQ
@vivin_the_life UW Lost We're Even
Proud of what this team has accomplished. Completely distraught right now.
Fact. "@Zengerle9: Madison, Wisconsin is still way cooler than Durham, North Carolina. #OnWisconsin"
@brenbren11 @KalinWhite but WISCO still wins though
@Joe_Gumina Hey now....
@fangsbites Grrr. https://t.co/b9Xa5vhwT6
@Purrff i think so. If its not, they dont really enforce whatever laws there are
@RemovableMoe moody before that play Kentucky got away with a personal foul
my heart is completely broken 😔
WAS THIS THE REF THAT THAT CALLL "NO ERA PENAL" !?!?!?!?!??!,!,!,!.!::$
I tired paying for Gina's pita but she said she's "fasting for the badgers"
Say what you want about Duke, Mike Krzyzewski exemplifies class
@RemovableMoe moody I'm about to kick your ass
@eric_h21 fuck themmm.
That was a great national championship game
😳 i knew it... http://t.co/TgePFxhWFR
How the hell am I supposed to go to school tomorrow
Didn't lose because of the team in stripes but we didn't get any help.
&amp; remember that #Wisconsin still gets a Runner Up National Champions Trophy &amp; Banner
Tonight we are all sad Wisconsin Teletubby http://t.co/fMVYUHHLOF
His finger was on that ball FUCK DUKE
Win or lose, I am beyond proud to have witnessed such a tremendous season by the Badgers and to be a… https://t.co/Qz20tPJsTZ
"Not a good idea"
@kiiiirstenjo aren't you already?
They're playing "Purple Rain" at this bar in Madison; it feels right.
Win with class, lose with class. Proud to be a #Badger
Long ride on the whiskey train due up
People Wanted To Talk Good Noise When UK Lost Guess What? Right Back At Cha😉😂
@YoungNico2x  Coach Doland must be happy as fuck
@Bob_Lesh I'm not a big basketball fan and I even I was wondering about some of those calls...
I can't believe this national championship was decided by the refs, it's the only thing I didn't want to happen.
On the plus side I had Duke winning in my bracket.
@RyCMeyers @KIRSCH_da_BAUM that call that gave duke possession definitely could have cost us the game.
I've never seen so much angry people as there is in Madison right now.
I hate bandwagon fans. You just like whoever beats wisconsin. #IHateYou
Congrats Duke. I'm going to let you celebrate but Wisconsin was robbed. (Yea I said it) 😛 #sorrynotsorry
@RemovableMoe and yeah the one where gasser got a clean rebound and clearly got hit in the face
Congrats on the big win tonight @lbudorick!
Worst call I've ever seen @NCAA
#fastforthebadgers
Regardless, I'm still proud to be from wisconsin❤️
And No I'm Not On The Bandwagon #BBN To The Bone💯💯
Take solace #Badgers - we may have lost but #Kentucky is still 38-1 #NationalChampionship #NCAATournament
http://t.co/VFJHhZOU07
"How'd you handle it like that tyus?" "Umm well I asked the refs for some help and it worked"
Still love @BadgerMBB with all my badger heart ❤️❤️❤️ #MadeEmBelieve
Great Run Bucky!
@LILNTHEBASEDGOD what song doesn't say the same thing 8 times now-a-days? listen to his other stuff yeesh
Not the outcome we wanted but so proud of my #Badgers.  Thanks for the epic run.  #classact #badgerpride #UWMBB #badgerforlife #OnWisconsin
True. But gotta get calls. 5 times hit in face. Nothing. 2 ob's not called on Winslow. Hard not to feel robbed https://t.co/oiV6qloRbr
@RemovableMoe mad salty right now

http://t.co/nrvVzSAFqk
Hey #Badgers fans!!  DON'T ACT LIKE KENTUCKY.  We're better than that and owe it to our team to continue our class act!
What the fuck. Honestly.
It's a sad day for us all
Okefor should cherish this he'll never "win" another championship with the Knicks
the year is 8000 and i have resurrected myself from the grave to remind everyone that IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WISCONSIN POSSESSION
@OG_bomo @RemovableMoe like to see you try

The #mvp of @marchmadness goes to the three players in stripes. #shame What's the point of replay review if you're gonna screw it up so bad?
@Rachel__Nichols 
Is that who that was with JJ? Lol I thought it was his sister!

So mad right now but our guys played they're hardest and I hope they don't take this too hard bc its no ones fault.
Let's go Wisco http://t.co/HJyJjtoYo6
This is sad and all, it really is...but a lot of people called me stupid for having Duke win the whole thing in one of my brackets..
@BadgerMBB words cannot express how proud I am of this team.  He gave me memories that will last forever and for that I am thankful
@Mr_Grandote @dukebasketball Well said.  Yes, a big congrats to the Blue Devils.
Fuck Duke http://t.co/AOsLyYwZOd
@SouthernCard ACC ACC ACC - I guess
Tyus Jones cheated in high school and needs an eyebrow wax STAT
One thing is always true, Wisconsin wins with class, and loses with class.
And a pedestrian just got hit by a car.....
Sometimes there's nothing you can do...
Will I remember this tomorrow? #OnWisconsin http://t.co/mC8XIVI8Ga
@ABNumberTwo then if you're going cheer for a different school, at least make it a Midwest one.
They already paid for the fireworks might as well use them@TeeLiciouss I don't like Duke at all. I'm not a Duke fan.!
@saramarietweets @UWBadgers @bigtenconf It's quiet in Madtown tonight.  But we are so proud of our team!  #Badgers

@JocelynMcCain35 i cant get a RT tho
Most heartbreaking year for Wisconsin sports, ever. I love Wisco tho, always will.
If this team couldn't make me believe in them more, I'm not quite sure what team would. #OnWisconsin ❤️
Leave it to @jimmyfallon and @FallonTonight to soften the pain of @BadgerMBB defeat. Thanks man!
National Beer Pong championship.  Lets set it up pussies. #OnWisconsin
@BadgerMBB 
Thank you Badgers for one of the most fun couple weeks Ive ever had! Lots of♡ in Madison #OnWisconsin
@FSKPart3 @JPGasser21 @T_Jacks12 @DDukan13 thank you seniors for the memories you've given me... You demonstrated the definition of team
Go pack Go!
My heart...💔
At least Duke can't say they beat Kentucky... I still love my boys❤️🏀 @BadgerMBB
Wisconsin has back to back final four appearances and 3 lottery picks.
Don't let a basketball game have that much of an impact on your life.
The fact that I don't have to go to school tomorrow &gt;&gt;&gt;
Win or lose we still booze ❤️ #OnWisconsin
Nobody Is Mad😌
@mooremt09 #ISU
@YoungPrevo lol they made it farther than anybody predicted , have 3 lottery picks and only lost by a few points.
Barkley days he has spent the past few days with Wisconsin fans. I have no doubt about that.
@_MCT3 Stephen Zimmerman,
#pulchritude of a season #Bucky!! Proud of the class, style, and humor of this team! #BadgersBelieve @BadgerMBB
I'm pissed. FU @DukeU. Wisconsin was robbed. #NCAAChampionshipRigged #ScrewDuke #sorrynotsorry
@mkrey5 you shut up
Why didn't Showalter play?
@YoungNico2x Thats Mr. Coach fuckin Doland to you
@Shaneypoo24 Good Game Wisconsin!
Well shit.
Unless you know your actually playing in the game or something.
@mkrey5 whoa whoa whoa what's with the language.
Instigating never gets anyone anywhere @KBreezy33
“@jtschllng: I've lost all faith in bo ryans system” STOP JT DONT SAY THAT we need to stick together darn it
I still wanna go to state street to get some emotional therapy for what just happened
@vivin_the_life 💤💤💤😴
@_MCT3 I Don't Know Who else That's not the Subject The Subject Is The Badgers Lost Now Bye👋👋
I'm in a state of depression and I am in tears...
Win or lose I love my badgers
The game was not even enjoyable to watch when the commentators were complete Duke fans...along with the refs
@dekker you need to stay another year. Wisconsin and sheboygan love you too much to for you to leave!
So @N_THEYSTAYTHERE was on point with his Duke tweets earlier. That's exactly why people hate Duke. Not "because they always win."
@maddiemouse50 @madisontraffic @dailycardinal Because we have a lot to be proud of!  #Badgers
Great year. I've never had more fun following a sports team.
Holy moly!  My teachers said I'd never amount to anything.  Take that Mrs. Miller!  Thank you @starwars http://t.co/jrd6IHcGR6
Dear Sam Dekker, I'm going to die if you don't come back next year Sincerely, I Love You
In case you're wondering how it's going downtown Madison... Just swell. #Chaos
Plz stop texting me sorry that we lost k thx
I will always believe in these #Badgers. Literally until the day I die. You have done what many consider impossible. #OnWisconsin
Wisco has THE best program in the nation. Bo coaches respect over everything and the players rep badgers on and off the court!! #proudbadger
I love my @BadgerMBB! #OnWisconsin #Badgers #proudtobeabadger
Made*
Bo subtly saying the refs were terrible
Im not even a wisco fan... I hate wisco tbh😂😂 i just know what's right and that game wasnt right👿
@TySpitsTruths I hate yoh
@vivin_the_life No Mf Nobody Is Worried About You Orrrr @SimplyAlizabeth 💤😈
In sports it's so hard for ur team 2b national/state champions so appreciate any championship whether it's conference or regional/sectional
Winning the championship was consolation, @BadgerMBB mad the city proud no doubt!!! #NationalChampionship #RollBadgers #BadgerNation
Immaturity never suits anyone
@sashapaps eva Jacobs haha well we were friends in like first grade at ps 99 before 52 way back in my salad days
@carnojoe We played a hell of a game and proved everyone we can kick ass. #BadgerNation
I think Bo's comments that it was a shame about all of the body contact in this game frustrating his guys points straight to the refs
I think I sprained my ankle and im HUST. Not not feeling it veCshde drunk
@aj453016 I agree but go look at Laettner's opinion haha
Great season, @UWBadgers @BadgerMBB We're glad we got to share it with you. Be safe tonight, everyone!
Win or loose we stay cool. #Wisconsin #Badgers #NCAA
Duke will always be there...they'll have 7 all americans every year. Wisco does it the hard way. I can't say enough about these guys
Wow. Bo all but squarely blames the refs.
So sad
Kentucky fans happy as hell 😂😂😂 #IHateYouToo
@_MCT3 I thought he Signed , And Isaiah Briscoe De-committed those were the only too I really favored.
@Diamond_Stone33 you're absolute trash
Proud of those guys so much and how they represented the school. If you don't like Wisconsin you can fuck yoself. You're school wasn't there
@ABNumberTwo too sad to argue, let's agree that Wisconsin&gt;Minnesota
So sick of getting hurt
@RealSkipBayless coming from the guy who said Wisconsin was worse than Arizona and would lose the past 2 games #SimmerDown
Just fuck the fuck off
"Okafor is ugly. Grayson Allen is prob gonna go bang his cousin. Tyus Jones looks like he plays with dead squirrels. I hate refs." -my dad
Seriously, Bo?  You whine always.  So you just said you lost because you weren't tough enough but complaining about it.  Lose graciously.
Don't give a Shit what ya say but Kaminski owned Okafur tonight.  @NBA #finalfourchampionship #NCAAChampionship
This seriously hurt...so bad
Sad day forBadger Nation. Great run by @BadgerMBB but it was not to be. We'll be back. #OnWisconsin
This press conference is ripping my heart to shreds
Unbelievable run. Thanks for the memories @BadgerMBB @dekker @FSKPart3 @DDukan13 @T_Jacks12 @JPGasser21 @BronsonK_24 @ZShowbball333
Fuck Duke and the refs.  You're championship means nothing @Duke_MBB http://t.co/IfxYtEjKaw
Be humble &amp; proud not immature &amp; cocky
@JNorm34 your
@cubs_scott @EB68 Castro needs to stop swinging for five-run home runs
@vivin_the_life @SimplyAlizabeth But Im taller😂😂You weren't watching the same game, were ya you little cunt?   "@RealSkipBayless: Not classy."
At least I'm not in Madison to die in these riots.... Oh
Happy for Coach K. As for the rest of the Dook nation, they can go fuck themselves. I'll be salty till next season no doubt.
@NCAA I guess touching a player's hands no longer means it's out on them. Has the world changed
Maybe more girls would be into sports if people didn't say they were fake fans or only watching bc they think the players are cute 🐸☕️
Still Love my school
@l_nowicki this still stands
Bo is so sassy I absolutely love it
Sorry to piss u off Twitter but this team made me smile since November. Shows you how tough to win a championship is in sports
@_DoubleOhKevin I know him
Hey guys I got interviewed by Fox News but I said this feeling is fucking amazing so I probably won't get aired lolol
@Nathan_Dupont I am. A cheap one though because I don't care anymore
Hey guys, isn't it nice to not have to see sad Pitt players during #OneShiningMoment? At least there's that.
Saturday, BBQ, guy day?  @zach_rust @samster_mac
Heck of a season #Badgers
FUCK DUKE!!!!!
@JohnBoelWAVE3 in Madison tonight. The guys/coach let that one go. A great run! #OnWisconsin
@Z_O_K_A_ but when the stage is that big and at least in the case of the second one, YOU CAN REVIEW IT, you can't fuck it up
@lookatmybhinze I'm serious! Let me know when you're free!!!!
That's the kind of game a championship game should be. Shout to both teams #NationalChampionship

"@NFL_Memes: THE CURSE LIVES ON http://t.co/VylkL7dos3" F*cking Romo.
@Z_O_K_A_ they were the "most experienced" refs and were literally trusted with the biggest game of the year and they blew it lol
Monday has never been worse
Doesn't matter #DukeStillBleedsRed
@Z_O_K_A_ lmao what They hit a 3 on both missed calls, that's 6 points they shouldn't have had that's not an excuse it's a fact lol
@KBreezy33 @kb_paul it also shows a major flaw in his character as a person
But forever a Badger fan ☺️
Blah blah blah duke still couldn't have beaten Kentucky
S/O to @thatnebraskan for being the best Cornhusker out there, especially during my time of mourning 😘 http://t.co/9iRi7Qnlwp

Thank you Frank Josh Duje Tre (probably Sam). I will miss you all. #BADGERS #OnWisconsin
@Z_O_K_A_ we did, it doesn't help that duke had at least 6 points they shouldn't have had lmao you're missing the point
Oh man Madison sis crazy right now http://t.co/G6QmomUoZc
Thanks UW basketball for making our little state feel special for a brief moment.  Played like champs even if you came up short.
But #ONWISONSIN I will never stop believing we are the best
A fire with no fuel will dwindle out

@threestangtyry Thanks Ty. They proved a lot of people wrong by making it that far. I'll be ok, just frustrated.
At least we still beat @KentuckyMBB.
@Z_O_K_A_ obviously they won't always go your way but it should at least be called fair on the biggest stage in the country
Always a proud Badger. It was an amazing season that I was lucky to be a part of! 👐❤️
@David17Manz dammit
@Z_O_K_A_ I'm not making excuses, we lost, the refs had a huge impact and anyone who denies that is an idiot lol
Can never blame the refs for an outcome but man were those refs bad...Come to the red side 😏
And to all Minnesota fans celebrating the Duke victory: talk to me when you can even make it to the tournament
The sun will rise tomorrow.
HOLY SHIT 😨 https://t.co/HfSxY1ziRt” YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT
@zach_rust @samster_mac we'll just do it on the back 😂😂
@Z_O_K_A_ I'm over the fact that we lost I'm just pissed the refs played such a big role in it
@Z_O_K_A_ exactly! THE REFS CONTROL IT, THEY SHOULDNT FUCK UP THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
Seriously tho all tournament it seemed like the refs favored a team in every game...hate when the refs make bad calls
@LiamMcGwisco @ScottWalker @BadgerMBB @UWBadgers lol he's still got @BenBrust in the pictures

Someone text me god damnit I'm sad and drunk
@SportsCenter the 3 refs
Wisco needs @dekker 👐
@SportsCenter The refs
I'll pay for the fine Bo. Speak for mind baby. Lol this is fucking hilarious. The media knows it too. Replay that game.
Drinking thru the 6 wit my woes #BadgersForever
@BadgerMBB Thank you for a great season!  #OnWisconsin
@SportsCenter sorry #SC3stars go to refs
@FazoDaKid fuck that
I judge a man on his intelligence and character not on the amount of money he MIGHT make in the Nba. Do you but you have no respect from me
Very proud of our UWBadgers! The greatest test of courage: handling adversity. http://t.co/t8RJrxtD0X
@kraydiomusic ❤️
My loss style is going back to my apt, heating up chinese and watching triple D💁
I'm sure the refs will come out and apologize profusely for the obvious blown calls. AFTER the fact.  #shame on @NCAA and #NCAAChampionship
I hope that ref feels like the players did once he sees how badly he messed up
@KBreezy33 good for you 👍Congratulations Duke! Still proud to be a badger 👐⚪️🔴
@austinnelson333 f u dude they're a joke
@samdorshorst @Nealdesai27 yo check out mine and @bennettw10 's video
@EazyE_88 lol your school is irrelevant and you can't help but hold onto rivalries instead of rooting for the school in ur conference
I am so proud of the sports season I had during my senior year❤️👐 #Badgers
@BrandonOmernik @buckwheat328 Cavs warriors finals and warriors win in 7
Great now I gotta go to my 8 am class tomorrow and listen to my prof talk about how badly we all did on our last exam
@Coach_Osborne play on coach, play on.
Just because I love Duke basketball doesn't mean I hate on Wisconsin. If Wisconsin played anyone else in that game I'd root for them.
I love my sister
Hey Gopher fans -- when your team doesn't even make the NIT, you're not even remotely cool for cheering on Duke and getting that 'victory"
@SimplyAlizabeth Girl, nobody Is worrrrried About UW nobody Is Going to be as Big As They Were This Year.
#FearTheDeer #Playoffs
@GrooGrocksKing there is absolutely no reason for a personal attack. Understand that not everybody agrees with you, and Duke is a great team
Great season. Proud of my school. On Wisconsin. Stay classy, no riots.
Badgers lost the title and I STILL HAVE AN EXAM TOMORROW EFFFFFF
Inside a potbelly's with 1 shoe, half a watch and a can of chew #SOS
If you're gonna blame the refs for bad calls make sure you blame them for missing their shots also.
@UWBadgers @BadgerMBB thank you thank you thank you!   You made us proud.  I only wish we could take some of your pain away We Believe.
The point isn't that the refs won the game for duke, it's that at the highest level they should not be fucking up calls they can look at
@CountOnVic 😫😫😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I watched the Brewers lose today. I watched the Badgers lose today. The world will watch me lose tomorrow when I have to be at work at 6:30.

DUKE MAKES ME PUKE @TLfittysixx
@ChewSiegs hey Drew... you go to Mankato
@Marty32Lucas I was waiting for a "but" 😉 I even agree with what you're saying. But Wisconsin still made some crucial mistakes.
Your turn.  https://t.co/s2USH6751Y
@davidwood2424 ayyyy a 20 on the ACT won't get you into UW, but Bo Ryan isn't looking for superstars, just kids that fit the system.. Final4
So many #Badger fans with #Blue #Balls
Still got that #badgerpride though
We went through Oregon, North Carolina, Arizona and Kentucky.  But we couldn't make it through the striped shirts. #shame on @marchmadness

@NIGEL_HAYES #DukeStillBleedsRed
@BrandanBackman until the Rasheed Sulaimon facts leak #scandal :0
never get too comfortable everything can change in a minute
That was an awesome run and I still love my University and my Badgers.  On Wisconsin!!! #MadeUsBelieve
@BadgerNoonan No Dekker, no offense down the stretch. Refs can't play for us. Or defend their 8th man from scoring 16 points
@ChewSiegs hey Drew, at least someone loves me 😏
#Badger fans, please maintain the level of  class displayed by our team. Behave tonight. Be safe. Good luck out there, @UWMadisonPolice!
It was a good game, even though we did not win. Go Badgers! 😉 @ State Street (Madison) https://t.co/lcMuFXRyTz
@GottliebShow Well...since Russell Wilson is a football player...
State St. crowd chanting, cheering, singing, waving Badger flags. And UW lost. What would reaction have been for victory? Probably the same.
@dekker all the kids will still be saying #MakeEmBelieve for a long time @tomolson24 http://t.co/FgCm7BXWQq
@RoBByCowles or maybe they were picking on him because of the fact he is laughing at Wisconsin
Cruel, Jake. Cruel.  https://t.co/RGtczfgOJ6
I hate Skip Bayless but I love those last tweets.
So fucking proud of my school, this team, and our pride. #OnWisconsin
@dekker no hate, bro.
Still skipping class tomorrow.@FSKPart3 @UWMadison No, THANK YOU, Frank!  You've given us a reason to smile, cheer, and to believe. You'll always be #1 to us.
It's just sports...
@MollDoll2196 @KardashianReact I'm not sure how that's relevant but it is
If anyone wants to hold me while I cry myself to sleep that'd be great
well we lost but a boy gave me his mixtape, so 💁
We don't need a title to tell us we're amazing... I still love my school @ double Dekker https://t.co/JIUr7Izzmk
Why can't things just work out for once.
@jackjohnsonmill the "Face Ripper" can't evade Jeremy Wade for long 🐟🐟🐟
@LongLive_TRaww  all love bro! Your family to me, we gotta keep hanging out more tho!
To completely top off the unfortunate nature of the night, we have school tomorrow...
Duke winning the championship brings the NCAA more money. Think on it. Replay that game.
I just gave 6 officers a high five becauze FUCK DUKE
Now it's back on to Buckeye Football! ☺
@BrycenSorensen if Dekker stays I don't think it'd be for this reason. I think it's for his degree. Because the NBA isn't going anywhere.
@dekker @AaronRodgers12 Never apologize for bringing joy to an entire state.  Best of luck to you, #SlamDekker.
Over it. #buckyisbetterthanduke #pukeydukey http://t.co/fpRyvKNCvi

Proud of Wisco, heartbreaking end but they made me believe. They proved it doesn't take 8 McDonalds all Americans to make it to the ship.
Duke is a private college, Wisconsin is a public college therefore Wisconsin are the National Public College Basketball Champs
For some reason, not that I'm surprised, but the douchiest tweets seem to be coming from MU fans, once again, where was your team?
Still working my ass off for a UW degree. I will be proud to call myself an alum and another title wouldn't change that #urahrah #wisconsin

@WernerESPNCU no, you're orange and blue glasses are reading into it from an anti-Wisconsin slant.
It's election day in #Wisconsin
I'd like to believe that Bo Ryan was complaining about officiating because of it's inconsistency not because they lost and that's the reason

@JonahMarais JONAH COME WATCH ME!!
Follow #Badgers@work for updates on tonight's social media discussion at UW - Madison's School of BusinessProvidence certainly deserves to be in the champ. Game sat. But I cannot remember the last time the two best teams played in the title game
So how is madison above sarah on my snap friends
@niky_hey the application of mathematics in social media is always very messy
@jblum34 that's more "I come in peace" but why don't I have that one
A lot of semi final match ups over the years that have seen the two best teams go head to head, a lot more parody in ncaa hockey now
@hockeybunny01 some mystery is good because it keeps people guessing and not assuming.
@niky_hey the actual effect it has on my life is very small so i'm okay with it i guess
@hockeybunny01 I'd like some book time after finishing a big project for client tomorrow.
@niky_hey oh believe me nik, i know
@hockeybunny01 but too much guessing is too much work and is frustrating. Then you think someone is hiding something.  It's a fine line.
Will never see new emojis because still not updating to ios8
Fucking opera nik???
@hockeybunny01 happy clients=more work=more $$.  It's well worth the time and investment. And I hope to join a BOD in the very near future

It's interesting to me that the girl who wrote the opinion piece about #LetTheFeathersFly didn't ask to wear any items of cultural+
It's kind of like 2 year old behavior. For example, young children may not want a specific toy and then another child starts playing with it
And these bitches gone roll with who they thinks a winner...
Only then does it become a problem and the child demands a turn with the toy.

It is early Sunday morning, but I already learned a new word that makes me sad: damselling &lt;c&gt;
&lt;c&gt; from what I can tell, and I may be wrong, it is being used by those in #GamerGate to accuse women of focusing on being victims &lt;c&gt;&lt;c&gt; or to accuse continent creators of focusing the portrayal of women as victims i.e. damsels. But the thing is &lt;c&gt;
&lt;c&gt; we so-labeled SJWs in academia and the arts fight against such portrayals and work to empower women. &lt;c&gt;
&lt;c&gt; if we could just talk and listen to one another instead of shout and posture at one another then we could all work towards these goals.
Also this seems to indicate furthering of tensions as ideologies involved in #GamerGate become connected to other fandoms #fracturedfandomInto English from Celtic by way of Italian. // Word of the Day - brio: vigor; vivacity. http://t.co/7fYecKWG1n
@Bob_Lesh please tell me it didn't rain last night!

I'm spoiled . Ima spoil my kids &amp; let them be kids . Some parents are mean af &amp; call it "parenting" I'll never do my kids like that .
@GigaWalrus @MADSwaggger what is this problem at the center that needs to be addressed?
I'm at @Walgreens in MADISON, WI https://t.co/NRDKy59Jsx
I never had a curfew . Tf . I had a key to my house &amp; a cell phone if needed to be contacted .Wooooooooah. Why, how, where, what, when?
Finna sell all my rocks &amp; now that I'm looking at it I want them 😩
Last night was amazing! #Madison
@GigaWalrus @MADSwaggger I have talked with intercultural scholars about how to do this, but how do you think it could be done?
My mom just found some old trues that I forgot I had &amp; I'm like naw I want these 😒 I have too many jeans
Anyone that tries to bring you down is just mad because you're happier than they are. Stay happy
I forgot abt all these Abercrombie jeans
@GigaWalrus @MADSwaggger I think you just nailed on the head why I want to focus on this as an issue in need of dialogue...
Yesterday was LIVE
@GigaWalrus @MADSwaggger we need people willing to engage in a conversation not to win an argument but to understand others' perspectives.
Who tryin to take ya boy to breakfast 👀
Oh hey! It's this dude's birthday! Even though we're both working two jobs and going to school and… https://t.co/hA8lqEtY86@Milkym0o nor is that law internationally or even faithfully applied in all circumstances, hence the need for new and better laws.
@April_Barr19 happy birthday April! Have an amazing and fun day!!
@Milkym0o true, under law you cannot discriminate, which is good. But that is not the only system at work in our societies and cultures.
I'm at Bus Stop #1323 {Bus I Take If I Work The Week End Or A Holiday} in Madison, WI http://t.co/u2lQYogZx0
@Milkym0o I think one of our differences is that feminists are not that advocating that the deck is stacked against women...
@Milkym0o so we want everyone to help identify those areas and work to fix them. We want to empower all people to be who they want to be.
@Milkym0o just that there are still areas where inequality occurs, for men and women, and that we should work together to fix those areas.
Nothing like being in urgent care on a Sunday!! Frack!! (at @UWHealth 1 S. Park Clinic in Madison, WI) https://t.co/Xt0TBAZzde

@bitfalls and then any class that implements your trait will be required to implement the method to get the information your trait needs.
@bitfalls can be done a few ways. one easy way is to not access the property but define an abstract protected method to get what you need.

But while I'm waiting to find out if a refill is approved I actually have no way of finding out if they refused it.70% semen
Also, calling before a few days pass is a bad idea because it can look like drug seeking behavior.
If they check off on the refill I get my refill. Ifnot it hangs out in limbo, and I can't actually call about it because its about a refill.
Everything on the ups now!😌

@theunzippedfly @JordanJamie It's very hard to have a PG who can't shoot well from beyond the arc in today's game.
@theunzippedfly @JordanJamie It's risk/reward. Rondo doesn't offer enough value as a player to pay him much. Bad for locker room too.
@SMischio54 sweet deal.
@theunzippedfly @JordanJamie It all just comes down to balancing the pluses and minuses with Rondo. At this point, he's more likely to fail.

@WSJbeerbaron @kylenabilcy I don't always drink at Jordan's Big 10 but when I do, I puke in the parking lot next to frat dudes going pee pee

@Sgroovy28 lol always does 😂
Billy Donovan made a U-turn the first time he put his toes in the NBA waters. Is an injury-riddled Kevin Durant worth it this time?
@Sgroovy28 nah I'm jp
@WSJbeerbaron @kylenabilcy oh! man, if you can hit the high and the low you're on your way in this city.

@AdamSandler indigenous people are #NotYourHollywoodIndian. By refusing to listen to them you are upholding dehumanization and stereotypes.
@audreyodori elderflower is so delicious!!
@realDonaldTrump @Barbie_Brooks To find strength and to declare bankruptcy.
@AdamSandler thank you for hiring Native actors, however, that's not enough. Why would they want to promote falsities about their culture?

mainstream society is intertwined with the erasure and stereotyping of Indigenous peoples. If truth comes out, blind patriotism will cease+
Totally normal to not celebrate with your teammate who assisted your game winning 3.
I'm really emotionally stressed but romantically relieved. does that make sense? no
@mehgcap Thanks, Alex. As the SDK opens up I think it will become a great assistive device. I’m hoping that comes this year.

Colonizer rhetoric must be unraveled lie by lie until all people say enough. No one deserves to have their culture mocked.

@AdamSandler Native Youth have a higher likelihood for completing suicide than their non-native peers. Your film dehumanizes them.
