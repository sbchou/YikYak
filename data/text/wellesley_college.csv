It'd be soo cool to win a national championship..
@neilbyrne_CT Noreen sounded incredible tonight! You keep getting drunker singing 7 Drunken Nights lol. Such a great night!
@GradyLiam @Neil_Hobbs5597 @MHanna_22 @WackAMole32 sorry duke's just better than your round of 32 team
That was a great game.
Christian Laettner is somewhere watching pissed because he knows the world won't hate Tyus Jones as much as they hate him
Rough one for this guy. http://t.co/AOUM7VAzsZ

@GraysonJAllen prom?
#PeopleWouldBeShockedThatI am a liberal but don't get all offended when someone makes a risqué joke or says something offensive
College b-ball sucks...Kaminsky fouled every time in 2 half and hardly a call...why even have a big man if he's held every time.
@soffeshortz 100p no doubt wisco&gt; all

@WackAMole32 sorry they are 19 year old kids who worked their balls off and want to celebrateMan, I want to win a nattttty
@nessy564 #dothedub
I don't know much about basketball but pretty obvious the refs wanted duke to win
Jahlil Okafor can I marry you?😁

@GrabakaHitman Would you really want him cracking the top 5, though? Even if he had beaten Al, he'd be on a 4 decision win streak
Phone interviews: make it sound like you're in dress pants even if you're in a towel
“@Factsarabic: تسعين ثانية هو ما يلزم دماغك ليحدد ما إذا أعجبك شخص ما أو لا !”
@GrabakaHitman I do, and I'm glad it didn't and I'm glad he did. Top 5 is title shot territory. 0 finishes in your win streak = low buyrate
@NBC10_Adam just my personal opinion but judge seems to have more tolerance towards defense...but she is not the jury..
@GrabakaHitman MJ, Ferguson, Iaquinta &amp; Burns finish fights. Cucoy's booked, but I'd much rather see 1 of the others given that opportunity

@CamInTaunton that's because they're locked into the 2 seed in the east..nothing to play for
The kitchen door at fridays legit just fell off and landed on a waitressSo like my bae @HillaryClinton is doing something on Sunday.
Side note: Has there ever been a parody of The Punisher called "The Publisher" about a newspaper editor who kills bad stories? #Marvel
Taking momma dukes out! #movies😃
don't play the nigga and just be like "naw I don't feel you" instead of giving the nigga attention and then dub him.
@BASS_GAWD I'll kick your ass when I get back home I'm in boston right now
@RedSox730 I love how your baseball tweets are profane and blunt. Exactly what I'm yelling at my tv hahah
If you come into a store a minute before they close to return something, you are literally the scum of the earth.
@BigCountryPhil and if Isaiah Thomas continues to pretty much be the best player ever...possible title
@nickiiib11 @TaaayKelly coming ☺️☺️☺️☺️
@BigCountryPhil they need one more player like a joe Johnson type guy and they'll be legit contenders soon
@justinmv15 @BucksWinItAll11 @ChristineSK_ @AshB_43 John Wall not playing tonight

This game has 17 full innings so far - or 48.57% of Teixiera's lifetime in years in innings. #RedSox

Hanley should get an assist on that #RedSox run for moving the runner to third the play prior. Right?

A million run lead wouldn't feel safe right now. #RedSox
YES

How are people still wearing those
mad nervous lmao.
It's real cool that I could watch the first inning of this Sox game, go out for the night, come back home &amp; I'm still able to catch the end
This game is a JOKE.
Tie game!!! Insane!
I'm binge watching an entire season of "The Red Sox" on Netflix right now. Huh? This is NESN? Go figure. #gosox

You can Bank on Chase! Huge first inning for the Yanks!
http://t.co/qZhIqqW7PKI have become the salt bender http://t.co/LqmOTcPwx0
This game though... lolol
Take Buchholz out of this game........
The phrase that I loved most! (at Fahadayna Private Library) [pic] — https://t.co/C6HTxyqTZK
Back to back! Stephen Drew!!
So does clay make it out of the first inning or..?
Yankees wasting absolutely no time tonight holy crap
@TonyMassarotti you are going to have a field day tomorrow. Buchholz is not an ace!
What an inning for the @yankees. Sweet swing from A-Rod, a bombs from Headley &amp; #Drew, and great hustle from McCann! #NYYvsBOS #SNB
😔 "@SneakerPics23: Shanghai 5's http://t.co/O6OXon8xwm"
Pretty certain I saw @Jared_Sully0 on Newbury after the game today.

When ur mom makes u and ur sister take a potential Christmas card picture but u just got out of a big fight http://t.co/B66Qsf4WVl
When Stephen Drew hits one out you know you have a problem
@Jared_Carrabis 8 innings left. Which means at least 3 Hanley HR's.
How are the Yankees winning 7-0 with 1 out in the bottom of the first #dead #done
Oh and that inning is still going. Thanks, Clay. #NYYvsBOS #SNB
@amyschumer can you say "celebrity nip-slip"
Buckholz is terrible

@drvox But American evangelicalism is fundamentally leaderless, whereas key component of catholicism is leadership by God's chosen Pope
HOLY SHIT! that scene between kenny and drew. mind blown. @jrlemon2 @unrealfehr #TheNightShift

@drvox Probably true in US except at margins. But w/ billion+ catholics outside US, could seriously alter global political environment
@aquart Isn't that what we have been doing on Twitter for the past hour?
im an actual hot mess
@drvox But: If Pope makes it central part of US visit, Im certain it will alter convo among my very conservative catholic family members.
I rather not text you all day than text you and have nothing to talk about........

I learned that if you really put your mind to it you can change
Which leaves Braun, Parra, Maldy, &amp; Broxton, none making much of a splash. Braun has lost value (duh), &amp; Parra is a backup aging fast. (4/5)

Broxton is a veteran with lost value, &amp; Maldy is good enough to start, but would inevitably be a backup. So...how to rebuild? No clue. (5/5)

Game 7 Monday night...nation's capital
"If you're dude is wearing a Laconia 2009 shirt, drop em"
"Do you ever think of me when you lie"
The Islanders "Yes" chants are so epic
This islanders game was nuts
@KateMerrill can you dig it?I hate to say it, but I don't think ZZTop 'topped' "Just Got Paid". Sometimes your earliest stuff is the best, more pure and immediate.
