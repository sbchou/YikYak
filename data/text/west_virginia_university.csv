Good game. But I think most people would rather see Wisconsin win...
It 100% touched his hand are you kidding me WHAT THE FUCK
TOUCHED HIS FINGER REFS
What is that call?
Reception must be that good in Indy.  Laughable.
@kaaycoop @ScrambledMeggs5 hahahaha crying
These refs unbelievable haha
NO WAY
God I hate Duke ...but give Grayson Allen some credit for keeping them in the game while Okafor was out✊
Big Jah proving to be the difference late in this one. Coach K letting last year's top recruit prove why he was so coveted. Such a presence.
Just kidding.
Game over
Wisconsin just got cheated from that call. You're fucking kidding me
That's ball game folks.
Why have instant replay if u still can't get it right #DukevsWis
Wonder how much Dukes paying these refs right now?
@richiestaubitz I took it back ASAP rocky lol. The good vibes are coming soon my friend
Are you f******** kidding me? 99 out of 100 teams get that call. 

But it's Duke.
Wtffffff, terrible call
That was definitely off of Winslow....
BAD CALL. AWFUL.
clearly out on justice winslow😡
Tell me again big money is not involved in college sports.
If that was dukes ball you can consider me Miles Davis
But so is Kaminsky! #ComeOn
How do we clearly see that call but the officials can't ?
Give the refs the trophy
These cocksuckin refs can't keep us down!
Frank is a boss
It was all in the script.
Tyus Jones is the truth!!!!
Wisco just got SCREWED on that review
Why do refs get paid?
He said shhhhh
This is perfect  https://t.co/NzwZ7YHrDm
Homemade Mac n cheese makes me so happy.
Off Winslow. Refs still don't win games.
@kbohls @AllanTaylorWVU completely unacceptable for the one game of the year where you HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF THINGS.
Bill Raftery with the #Onions call at the perfect time. Duke fans can say Buh-bye to Tyus Jones. NBA Lottery selection.
His finger was seen touching the ball by everyone around the world watching this game and still give the ball to Duke?
Remember when Lehigh beat Duke
#balldontlie #refsdo
No bye
Fuck duke

GAME OVER!!!!!!
The need to do away with the review in college BB.  It only proves the refs are blind. #embarrasing
@joe_twynam RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET most relevant tweet I've seen ever class went from 0 to 100
Gosh I can't stand duke lol
100% the refs fault.
Its over..
As long as #Kentucky didn't win, idgaf
Such a terrible shot!
Makes no sense you give up 2 points ?? Just awful
NOOOOO
Damnnn
Just wanted Wisconsin to win so bad =(
What a game. Closet Duke fan for life. #LetsGoDuke
All I'm sayin
Nooooooo
What're my chances of meeting @JJWatt if I make a spontaneous trip to Houston in the future 😍😁✈️
Speechless
Same teams every year. Blah. #NationalChampionship
Go Duke
The referees are the 2015 National Champions
Duke...wins...again. It's like clockwork.
YAY. WVU WON.
Duke wins a national championship. Sports fans everywhere lose at least 10 minutes of sleep tonight
damnnnnn
Booo
I am one happy camper
Wisconsin chokes every year
Time to trash talk tweet
You know what's worse than kentucky winning the national championship? duke winning the national championship
What a fun season.
DUKE DUKE DUKE DUKE DUKE 💙💎
Duke won the entitled. #NCAAChampionship
I hate them so much. So much.
I do love how everyone in the country hates this team though I know like 3 dook grads lol http://t.co/Dvysw8qwSz
#CoachK does it again #NationalChampionship
True story: I would have rather Kentucky win it!
Follow @MotherCourageWV for direct access to Mother Courage at WVU! #doit #allthecoolkidsdo #youknowyouwantto
We coulda beat Duke
I would rather see Pitt win a title over Duke
@wvuDmoney @zachbraff you're right it's about equality.
Fuck Duke
Duke hit some clutch shots coming down to the end, cant blame the refs one bit
Dukeeeeeeeee!!!!!! $$$$$ Needed that after Kentucky fiasco!
Coach K is a great coach though
What a game! Even tho refs missed two blatant out of bounds calls on Duke.
Everyone from Wisconsin is about to go on a huge cheese binge for months
Should have been Wisconsin ball but 🐸☕
I still hate Christian Laettner
WHY IS THIS SONG PLAYING i DON'T CARE
The duke cheerleaders running out like they did something 😂😂
Now it's all shitty sports until football season
Duke wins my bracket wins ahhh what a good night 💙👌
Coach K to Tyus Jones: "I love you bitch. I ain't never gonna stop loving you, bitch."
Out of bounds call goes Dukes way, Paige hits a 3 and changes the entire momentum of the game.
Damn...Coach K got a ring for each finger...you better be buying Grayson Allen dinner for the next year!
OH OH OH THIS IS MY JAM
"Give credit to Dukes Defense" let's be honest credit for that win goes to the Refs
Sahara is a duke fan BC of Nathan Scott... I can't believe she even watched that last 5 minutes...
@Treetone_ no man I was talking about fútbol! The true best sport on earth! #noteasy #panera
@Em_Chess well....lacrosse.
Like rooting for ISIS at this point  https://t.co/g1Iaabuv0t
duke.... vomit
First Ohio State. Now Duke. 2014-2015 NCAA can f*** right off. ✌️
@Whos_Colton baseball just doesn't do it for me. Too slow paced. I'll watch a game 7 any day tho
"Forget the pedi, he needed the mani!"
Got to respect duke tho they have an all time great coach and they do things the right way
Cheer up Wisconsin, at least you will have a relevant team in the only sport that really matters 🏈🏈🏈.
Congrats to Duke but Eat Shit Pitt. 💩
Only hate the road when you’re missin’ home
@gabbygrates @HitsonHits @3MGawd we need to go.
UGH I wanted Wisco to win but congrats to Duke #NationalChampionship
For all you people that trash talk Duke. We have 5 championships and consistently win every game. Don't hate the player hate the game.
http://t.co/e4SJXOBqLi
Told you Duke would win it all dad.
@saharalester I think it's funny that you can't name a single person from any other team then wvu😅
@Meso_Thorny okafor is strong and one of the best finishers in traffic idk I don't think frank will either tho
Notre Dame would have beat Duke
But seriously congrats to Duke. Jones and Allen stepped up and made plays, Dekker did not. Duke was the better team on this night.*off Twitter for the next week*
Please boo Mark Emmert.
damn those hats are 🔥
Duke either loses in the 1st round or wins the whole thing, that's what it always seems like.
Duke, Ohio State, and the Pats all have own championships so far this year. Three most stuck up and obnoxious teams in sports
Still split between K and Wooden for best Coach of all time.
When Dook wins http://t.co/jJ3YPQTpv1
Fack
I wonder which Duke player is smashing Belle Knox this evening. 😂😂😂
jk we all know I would die lmao.
BOOOOOOOOOO SCREW YOU MARK
Safe to say Krzyzewski-Ville can now open a second location in Indianapolis. Coach K has two titles under his belt in Indy.
Well if I was in middle school, I'd be one happy girl right now #DukeNation #Dukewasmyteambackthen
But could Duke beat the 76ers?
Exactly https://t.co/632HhCBm0G
My twitter is broke
78 Thursday, we goinnn out. @ChristianDenoir @joybellaa @_erinneary_ @Alex_Adaos8 @_valenciaaaa_ @_imSpoiled @j_kayerannals
Definitely one of the best National championship game we have had in the recent years #CoachK #OneShiningMoment
@RG_the1st don't even get me started lol. The MHS of college sports
@MWolfley @Meso_Thorny I mean 4 points is big in the last 2 mins If you think about it
The only good thing about this national championship is that we found out Okafor can't guard a skilled big man #GoodluckintheprosBUM
I just hate duke so fucking much
@saharalester no I'm just disappointed... you can't even name 1 from WVU
Who is lighting fireworks on Spruce 👀
Who's winning the match ???
Did someone just get shot wtf
@lexkovacs dont talk
Don't care what anybody says tho UK is still the best team but best team doesn't always win it
Those snapbacks are tough tho.
@DropTheDomOnEm the thought kills me
Jahlil will get worked in the NBA, and has a possibility of going to the Knicks. Rip my nigga.
The new snapchat confuses me. It seems shady 😎🔥☺️😏
Wonder if Frank will use any racial slurs tonight
Anyone else hearing gun shots downtown?
wow I can't wait to be at Pirates games this summer

Welp, bring on "One shining moment"
http://t.co/00fGKKER7i
@iAhnieyahlate lmao my writing would be much smaller shiiid I would type the shid and paste it there
There isn't a coach who deserves it more!!! 💙💙💙 #CoachK #DukeNation
#TBH duke should be thanking Wisconsin though, they wouldn't have touch Kentucky,
GIVE IT TO ME! GIVE ME ONE SHINING MOMENT
@MWolfley @Meso_Thorny yeah, every college championship game has one of those guys off the bench that holds the team😂
@Treetone_ :(
Sad Wisconsin lost but still happy for duke #itsjustagame
Well another March Madness, another 1.5 billion in the books for the NCAA. See ya next year!
@_xoxomaggiee absolutely😁👌 golf is the best😎⛳️
Glad af that it wasn't Kentucky.

I cannot stand when people think they have to be "original" you aren't original your annoying. My goodness it drives me nuts #hateeverything
I almost hate to say this, but WVU would of given Duke a game. If we could of ran the press well, their 8-man roster would lead to weariness

@zachmyracle14 I saw quite a few of our fans saying WVU could beat OSU after Ohio State won the title, which I really disagreed with, but
@rihanna where's it at? 😑
I'm actually pissed Wisconsin didn't win so there's that
Love seeing the Salty UNC fans. I know my dude @elijahhbarnes is hype!  #AintWorriedBoutNothin #TheChampsAreHere #DukeNation #OrderRestored
so no one told you life was gonna be this waaaaaaay 👏👏👏👏👏
@zachmyracle14 I'm just saying I could see us giving Duke a game, as long as we didn't play like we did against UK.
@CBSSports No Staten?   No Tarik three  pointer?   #missedafewshiningmoments. #wvu

The fact that the government get to make money off students who are already expected to pay upfront for college infuriates me
the was he looks at me (&gt;) the way you look at me. still choose you. why?
Just because my family makes enough money to support itself does not mean we can pay $28,000 out of pocket
But the government knows that and forces us to take out loans with huge interest rates while big businesses get loans with no interest rates

Things overheard at the cafe : "I won a twerking contest last night."
@bananafarmer I definitely don't deserve this as much as I clean my room AND myself. I should be the last one getting this.

@foxgoddesss it's terrible. Literally the worst.
Not worried about public relations
I knew this shit before I knew this shit now I'm just learning fancy words for it
When I find out who gave me pink eye I will break both of their legs.
